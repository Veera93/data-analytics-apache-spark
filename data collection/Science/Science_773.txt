 Historically, our sun is the only thing guaranteed to be eaten during a solar eclipse. “A frequent theme is ‘the gods are angry, man has displeased them and they are taking the sun,’” said Fred Espenak, an eclipse chaser who has traveled around the world for 27 of these events. The ancient Chinese believed it was a dragon who snapped up the sun; the Vikings thought it to be a pair of wolves. This year, when the sun and moon do their celestial two-step over the United States on Aug. 21, it will happen around lunchtime in some parts of the country. Plan for a picnic, as many of the best places to see the total solar eclipse this month are off the beaten path. You may not be near a food truck or snack stand, and even where there are concessions, you might have to wait in long lines to buy a meal. Fried chicken, pastas and salads can withstand travel. Sandwiches may get soggy, depending on their fillings, so bring components in separate containers and assemble them at the viewing site. If you are organizing an eclipse party, choose thematic dishes like blackout cake, crescent cookies or dishes with sun-dried ingredients. As the total solar eclipse crossing the United States is an infrequent occurrence — the next one is in 2024 — an over-the-top project dish like timpano would not be out of place. Or choose recipes from the cities along the path of the moon’s shadow: shrimp and grits from Charleston, S.C.; hot chicken from Nashville, or Kansas City-style barbecue. Last, don’t forget the toast. “People like to have some champagne after the eclipse,” Mr. Espenak said. More: Solar Eclipse Recipes from NYT Cooking
