 Q. I live on a rural road in Connecticut and see lots of roadkill, but no dead rabbits. Why? A. Rabbits are famously fast and can see in both directions at once because of their eye placement, but they are not immune to highway death. The ratio of rabbit fatalities to overall roadkill varies from road to road and season to season, not to mention the importance of other factors, like species population trends. On a 112-mile stretch of highway in Wyoming, for example, 3,000 dead white-tailed and black-tailed jack rabbits, as many as 70 a mile, were counted during a 2006 population explosion in the Thunder Basin National Grasslands. Meanwhile in Connecticut and surrounding states, the New England cottontail or woodland rabbit, Sylvilagus transitionalis, is under great pressure from factors including habitat loss and fragmentation. It is estimated that rabbit skulls represent 10 percent or less of skulls collected by hunters or in roadkill, down from as high as 20 percent recorded in the 1980s. One problem for all but the most clever of rabbits is that some instinctual behaviors to evade diving raptors, like zigzagging and circling or even rushing across the presumed flight path, can put a rabbit right back in the path of a car.
