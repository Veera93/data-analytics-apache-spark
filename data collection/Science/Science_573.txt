 Q. When the recent hurricanes hit, how did animals seek refuge? A. For most wildlife, there is no early warning system when a big storm approaches. Most animals have no choice but to shelter in their usual environments. Some birds, however, respond to weather signals like changes in barometric pressure and fly ahead of the storm. A few get caught in high winds and sent many miles away. A displaced roseate spoonbill, presumably from Florida, recently was observed in New Jersey. The American Bird Conservancy reported that after hurricanes Irma and Maria reached the Caribbean, many flamingos left the islands of Inagua in the Bahamas ahead of the storm, returning in force afterward. But flamingos on the Cuban island of Cayo Coco died in the thousands. In Puerto Rico, conservationists are worried about several species of birds and other animals in the island’s El Junque rain forest, which was devastated by Hurricane Maria. When Hurricane Harvey reached the coast of Texas, the National Wildlife Federation observed that many animal and bird species had adapted to periodic hurricanes. Still, the severity of this fall’s weather prompted the release of toxic chemicals from various sites that could compound the usual problems, the group said. One area of special concern is the rich oyster beds of Galveston Bay. The storm was expected to change the normally saline environment to freshwater for weeks, perhaps longer than the oysters could tolerate. In Florida, the endangered Key deer is a good swimmer, and some have been spotted since the storm surges of Hurricane Irma. But they may struggle to survive in an altered habitat. Sea turtles build nests with good drainage, so at least some eggs are deemed likely to have survived the hurricanes. But many nests were destroyed by Irma.
