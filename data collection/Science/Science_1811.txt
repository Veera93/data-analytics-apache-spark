 Apes know what you’re thinking. Or at least an experiment suggests they do. Researchers at Kyoto University and Duke University had chimpanzees, bonobos and orangutans watch a video of an actor and a man in a King Kong suit hiding an object under boxes. In the end, King Kong runs away with the object. Then the actor returns. The experimenters tracked the apes’ gaze, which showed the animals correctly anticipated that the actor would head for the last place he saw the object. The apes knew the object was no longer there, and they apparently knew the actor would believe it was. Put another way: They knew what the actor believed, and they knew the belief was false.
