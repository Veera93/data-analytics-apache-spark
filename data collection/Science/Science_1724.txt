 When a whale sings, it fills the sea with more than just serene sounds. It also sends vibrations coursing through the water like a speaker with the bass turned way up. Though scientists have long listened to the marine mammals’ melodies, they haven’t really been feeling the music. Now, a new study highlights this overlooked and poorly understood component to the whale’s song. In a paper published Wednesday in the journal Biology Letters, a team of researchers reported detecting humpback whale vibrations from more than 650 feet away. The researchers said that the rattles traveled farther than expected, suggesting that they may play a role in whale-to-whale communication. “They are these noisy animals in the ocean — noise is central to their biology,” said T. Aran Mooney, a biologist at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution in Massachusetts and the lead author on the study. “We have not really been measuring half of the whale sounds out there.” Dr. Mooney and his colleagues first recorded the vibrations while conducting research into the acoustics of coral reefs in Hawaii. They were out on a small research boat when they picked up the vibrations using a tool known as an accelerometer. That tool and a hydrophone for listening to sounds underwater allowed the team to collect data about two components of the whale’s song: the sound pressure and the particle motion. Sound pressure is what you hear, like the music from a radio. “Particle motion is like being next to a speaker at a rock concert,” he said. “You can feel it.” But sound travels much farther in water, and subsequent research has shown that whale song vibrations can go as far as 3,000 feet. Researchers still don’t know everything about how whales hear the sounds. Dr. Mooney said they might feel the vibrations in their bones. He suggested that further research could reveal whether whales respond to these vibrations and use them to communicate.
