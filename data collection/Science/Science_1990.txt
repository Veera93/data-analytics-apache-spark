 Q. I observed a school of fish swirling around in a clockwise manner. Do they all do that? A. Schools of fish swim in either direction, and scientists have not determined what factors determine it. The synchronized behavior of schools of fish is a source of fascination to researchers, with some of the latest findings, in a study of sticklebacks published this month in the journal Genetics, suggesting that the behavior is genetically coded, rather than learned. There have also been limited studies of so-called handedness in fish, that is, the tendency for one side or other to dominate in organ development or activities like feeding. In one such study, 50 Norwegian salmon farmers were asked to note the swimming orientation of their penned fish, Atlantic salmon, which swim in patterns that resemble the behavior of fish in schools. The farmers reported that the swirling might go in either direction, but that once the fish showed a given orientation, they maintained it, regardless of tide or season. “What determines the original orientation remains a mystery,” the researchers said, but added that it was “probably not chance, because neighboring pens tended to show the same orientation, suggesting common cause.” question@nytimes.com
