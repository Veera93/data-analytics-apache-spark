 Pluto is hazy, with a chance of clouds. Scientists working with data from NASA’s New Horizons spacecraft, which flew past Pluto last year, are presenting some of their latest results this week in Pasadena, Calif., at a meeting of the American Astronomical Society’s Division for Planetary Sciences. The findings include images showing seven small, bright spots that might be clouds floating just above Pluto’s surface. New Horizons had already discovered haze in Pluto’s tenuous atmosphere, rising more than 120 miles into the sky and separated into at least 24 distinct layers. “But hazes are not clouds,” S. Alan Stern, the principal investigator of New Horizons, said during a news conference on Tuesday. Hazes spread out and do not block sunlight. If you were to stand on Pluto and look upward, its haze would filter only 2 percent of the light, Dr. Stern said. A cloud, on the other hand, is a puff that you cannot see through. The crystal-clear images that New Horizons took during its flyby in July 2015 showed that Pluto was almost entirely cloud-free. But careful sifting of high-resolution images revealed seven possible clouds, although Dr. Stern said there was no way to know for sure. All seven are bright features of similar size — on the order of miles — and all occurred near dawn or dusk, perhaps times when Plutonian clouds are more likely to form. “We don’t see any decks or banks of clouds,” Dr. Stern said. “We see individual, discrete potential cloud features.” Bonnie J. Buratti, an astronomer at the NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, also noted the widely ranging reflectivity of Pluto’s surface. Regions near the Equator reflect just 8 percent of the sunlight, while places in Sputnik Planitia, the western half of the heart-shape feature on Pluto, are as bright as fresh snow.
