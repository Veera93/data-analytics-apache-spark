 Q. Are decreasing levels of vitamin B12 in old age related to the insomnia from which so many older people suffer? A. There are many causes of insomnia in older people, most of them related to some kind of illness, and B12 deficiency can have many neurological consequences. But scientific studies focusing on that nutrient and sleep in the elderly are lacking. Insomnia is known to increase in older people, with prevalence rates as high as 65 percent, depending on the criteria used, according to a review of 50 studies of insomnia in general. Healthy older people who are not in institutions were found to sleep as well as younger people. B12 deficiency is also more common in the elderly because of dietary, digestive and absorption problems. B12 is involved in many nervous system processes. There is strong evidence that deficiency of the vitamin is linked to abnormal mental symptoms, including dementia, psychosis and mood disturbances, according to a Mayo Clinic review, but its role in sleep disorders has yielded unclear results. In two small studies, published in the journal Sleep in 1990 and 1991, four people were successfully treated for sleep-wake rhythm disorders with B12 supplements, even though their B12 levels were normal. Insomnia is known to have a strong link to depression, and one case study of a severely depressed elderly patient found that treating her B12 deficiency significantly improved her mood. The results, published in 2009 in The Primary Care Companion to The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry, led researchers to suggest that people with mental disorders such as treatment-resistant depression be evaluated for a B12 deficiency. They also called for large-scale research on the subject. One of the first broad studies to consider the effects of vitamin supplements on sleep found that, in general, taking them was actually associated with sleep disorders, but no cause-and-effect chain was shown. question@nytimes.com
