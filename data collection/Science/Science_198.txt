 Q. Does it take longer to cook food at higher altitudes, and does it cool more quickly there? A. Some foods take longer to cook by some methods at altitudes higher than 3,000 feet above sea level. But other foods actually take less time, according to the Department of Agriculture. The key factor is declining air pressure at higher altitudes. Falling air pressure lowers the boiling point of water by just under 1 degree Fahrenheit for each 500 feet of increased elevation. The lower boiling point means water will cook off more quickly, and at a lower temperature. Any food prepared with moist-heat methods, like boiling or simmering, will take longer to become fully cooked. And because these foods generally arenâ€™t as hot as they would be at sea level, they will cool off more quickly. With some other methods, like oven roasting, normal sea-level cooking times still apply, because the heat inside the oven is not affected by the lower air pressure. Some foods in a microwave oven may cook more quickly at higher altitudes, because the water in the food will boil off faster. This does not hold true for meat, poultry, pasta and rice, however. Cakes, breads and other foods that contain leavening agents rise more quickly at higher altitudes, because gases produced by the agents expand faster than at sea level. The loaves may collapse if the gases dissipate before the proper temperature is reached. Most baking recipes can be adjusted for high altitudes. A pressure cooker can mitigate the problem for many dishes, as the pressure inside the vessel can be controlled by the cook.
