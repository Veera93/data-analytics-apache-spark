 Scientists studying oysters along the East Coast may have discovered why more seafood lovers are getting sick from shellfish. A new strain of the bacteria Vibrio parahaemolyticus, is causing diarrhea, vomiting and abdominal pain. The strain, ST631, is endemic to the region, but it is unclear how it became so noxious. Research suggests this bacterium and others may be spreading because of climate change. The discovery may reduce the risk of food poisoning. Scientists have developed a model that estimates the odds of bacteria in New Hampshire oysters.
