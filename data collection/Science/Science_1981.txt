 Ötzi the Iceman was a dapper dresser. About 5,300 years ago, he sported a fur hat made from a brown bear, a sheepskin loincloth, leggings and a coat made of goat hide, shoelaces from wild cows, and a quiver made from deer leather. Researchers from the Institute for Mummies and the Iceman at the European Research Academy in Bolzano, Italy, used genetic testing to identify the animals that made up the frozen mummy’s fur and leather ensemble. Their findings were published Thursday in the journal Scientific Reports. Ötzi, as he became known, was found face down in a thawing glacier in the Ötztal Alps, which border Austria and Italy, nearly 25 years ago. Since then, researchers have learned a lot about his life from studying his caramel-colored corpse. The Iceman had an arrow in his shoulder, parasites in his gut, wild goat meat in his stomach and tattoos all over his body. Now his wardrobe is giving scientists information about how the Copper Age man dressed.
