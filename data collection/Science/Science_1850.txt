 The Hubble Space Telescope has found further evidence that plumes of water erupt through the icy surface of Jupiter’s moon Europa. If the geysers do exist, they may provide NASA with opportunities to study the moon’s subsurface ocean during flyby missions. “We may be able to explore that ocean of Europa for organic chemicals or signs of life without having to drill through miles of ice,” said William Sparks, an astronomer with the Space Telescope Science Institute in Baltimore.
