 One of the great treasures in ocean preserves is the Pacific Remote Islands Marine National Monument, established in 2009 and expanded in 2014 to cover about 370,000 square miles. That’s a lot of water to explore, and this year the research vessel Okeanos Explorer has been doing just that, collecting data and videos on the ocean and some of the astonishing creatures that live there. The ship is operated by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, which studies oceans and climate change, among other subjects. Scientists on board the most recent cruise — southwest of Hawaii — used a remotely operated vehicle, the Deep Discoverer, which can descend almost 20,000 feet, to take video of remarkable creatures like the deep water siphonophore. These bioluminescent tubes (which can grow up to 140 feet long) are actually colonies of smaller organisms that have specialized jobs, like swimming or reproducing. The scientists are trying to establish a baseline for parts of the vast monument area so that they can monitor the effects of ocean acidification and climate change. The recent cruise ended Sunday. Another expedition is planned for late April.
