 Q. Will Earth end up with a Saturnlike ring someday because of all of our space junk? Or is there one already? A. There is a big difference in materials and scale between the visible rings of Saturn and the smattering of Earthborn items that have ended up in orbit, according to NASA. Some of the material that humans have sent into space can be visualized as a ring at a specific location, called the geostationary orbit. This is where weather and communications satellites orbit Earth at the same rate as the planet turns on its axis, so they always stay above a single spot on the surface. When these satellites have outlived their usefulness, they will be moved to another orbit. Most of the rest of what is left in space is widely scattered in different orbits. Space scientists keep track of the larger debris  so they can maneuver to avoid collisions with useful spacecraft like the International Space Station and Earth-observation satellites. There is not likely to be enough space junk to form visible rings. Material in lower orbits often falls back to Earth after several years, though things in higher orbit may stay there for a century or more. United States policy aims to minimize the creation of new space debris. Other countries and individual companies also try to control it, by national policy or voluntarily. Saturnâ€™s apparently permanent rings are made of ice and rock, often very large chunks. Their exact origins are uncertain. One theory is that the rings resulted from the collision of asteroids and other bodies with the many moons of Saturn. Another is that they are leftover material from the original formation of the planet. question@nytimes.com
