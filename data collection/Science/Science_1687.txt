 Scientists have discovered three new species of salamanders, and it’s no wonder no one ever noticed them before: The salamanders are about two inches long, live deep in the Mexican forest — and are nearly extinct. All three belong to the genus Thorius, perhaps the most endangered genus of amphibians in the world. The scientists distinguished the three new species by differences in their skeletons and by DNA sequencing. They have been named T. pinicola (it lives in pine forests), T. longicaudus (for its tail, which is longer than its body), and T. tlaxiacus (from Heroica Ciudad de Tlaxiaco, the city nearest where it was found). “In some respects, amphibians are the canary in the coal mine,” said James Hanken, the director of the Museum of Comparative Zoology at Harvard, who reported the discovery in PeerJ. “The same environmental insults that are hammering them are hammering other species, including humans,” he said. “It’s not just salamander freaks who should be concerned.”
