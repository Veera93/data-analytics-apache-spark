 Q. Can you make medications safe to flush into the waste stream by using chemicals? A. It is possible, experts on drug chemistry say, but the very wide variety of drugs and their chemical structures make it unlikely that an individual could accomplish this safely and effectively at home. In fact, the Food and Drug Administration publishes a list of drugs that it recommends disposing of without treatment by flushing down the toilet or drain as soon as they are no longer needed, if an authorized collector is not available. “Based on the available data, F.D.A. believes that the known risk of harm to humans from accidental exposure to these medicines far outweighs any potential risk to humans or the environment from flushing them,” the agency says in a fact sheet. Some of these drugs, like strong pain medications, can be dangerous or even fatal if a single dose is taken accidentally. Flushing removes them safely and permanently from the home, while disposing of them in the garbage, even mixed with dirt or cat litter, might still pose a risk. As for the overall risk of drugs in the waste stream, many drugs have traveled via human waste into streams and rivers. The possible environmental impact is not fully known, but amounts comparable to those found in the water supply have been found in some studies to have harmful effects on birds and animals. A World Health Organization report identifies some ways to neutralize or remediate such emissions through waste water treatment methods including filtration, treatment with ozone and oxidation. question@nytimes.com
