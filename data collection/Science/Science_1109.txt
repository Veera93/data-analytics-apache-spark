 About 1,900 years ago and 1,350 light years away, stars in a giant gas cloud behind the Orion constellation collided, ejecting two other young stars. With a telescope, the blast would have been visible from Earth about 500 years ago. Now, with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array, the most powerful telescope on Earth, astronomers have captured pictures of the explosion. According to John Bally, who published a study of the event in The Astrophysical Journal, the debris is still flying and will gradually fade from view. What will remain are the ejected stars â€” pushed hundreds of light years away from Orion, runaways born in a burst of cosmic fireworks.
