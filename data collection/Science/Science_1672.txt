 Q. As the autumn leaves change color, why is the top of a leaf the most colorful, sometimes bright red, while the underside is comparatively drab? A. Within the complex layered structure of a thin leaf, the largest share of the pigments involved in the color change is found in a type of cell near the top surface called palisade cells, or the palisade parenchyma. Inside the palisade cells, in structures called chloroplasts, most of the leafâ€™s business of photosynthesis is carried on using the familiar green pigment called chlorophyll. The cells are near the top of the leaf, allowing the chlorophyll to absorb light energy to power the process. The cells of the underside, with far fewer chloroplasts, carry out other functions that do not rely on sunlight. For example, guard cells control pores for moisture, oxygen and carbon dioxide balance. Responding to signals from the changing light, the aging leaf shuts down the water supply to its chlorophyll factories in the fall, often revealing yellow to orange pigments, called xanthophylls and carotenoids, that are already present. The leaf also increases production of the predominantly red pigments called anthocyanins, which are deposited in the palisade cells. Recent research has suggested that the anthocyanins have a protective role, keeping the leaf from suffering too much damage from sunlight and oxidation as its function tapers off. They, too, may show bright red as chlorophyll fades away. Eventually, all these bright pigments fade, leaving only the drab brown tannins. question@nytimes.com
