 Q. Are the heavy metals removed from wastewater valuable? A. The main goal of removing heavy metals from wastewater is environmental protection from harmful substances, like copper compounds. Much of what is recovered, like lead, is of low value. But some treatment processes do recover valuable metals. A review article in The Arabian Journal of Chemistry in 2011, about the many ways to treat industrial wastewater, pointed out that electrodialysis was experimentally effective in capturing both copper and chrome. Another technique, combining water-soluble metal-binding polymers with ultrafiltration, also has been shown to be effective in selectively recovering various metals. Of particular interest is recent work on extracting precious metals like gold and platinum from wastewater linked to sources like automobile catalysts and hospitals. Treatment of water that contains only a small amounts of precious metals has not yet been economically effective, but microbial methods are being studied for the purpose. In a study published in the journal Nature Nanotechnology in 2016, a hybrid membrane made of low-cost activated charcoal and whey protein fibers showed promise in selectively  removing various metals from water. It could someday play an important role in gold recycling, the researchers said. question@nytimes.com
