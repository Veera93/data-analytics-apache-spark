 Q. Has there ever been a scientific study of whether copper bracelets ease arthritis symptoms? A. A controlled, double-blind study in England in 2013 found that copper bracelets and other folk remedies, like magnetic straps, were no more effective against arthritis than a placebo. The study, published online in the journal PLOS One, involved 70 patients with painful rheumatoid arthritis. They were randomly selected to wear four devices in a different order: a magnetic wrist strap, a very weakly magnetic strap, a demagnetized strap and a copper bracelet. Each device was worn for five weeks, with a week in between devices. Pain was assessed by subjective questionnaires as well as by studying physiological signs, like swollen joints and physical function, and medication use. Sixty-five of the subjects provided full data to the researchers. At the end of the trial, the authors concluded: “Wearing a magnetic wrist strap or a copper bracelet did not appear to have any meaningful therapeutic effect, beyond that of a placebo, for alleviating symptoms and combating disease activity in rheumatoid arthritis.” A systematic review in 2012 in the journal Rheumatology assessed English-language studies of a dozen alternative healing approaches used in medical treatment of osteoarthritis, including copper bracelets. The review found no good evidence for recommending any of the treatments, but also insufficient evidence that they were not useful. The overall results were judged inconclusive at best, and only a study of copper bracelets did not report any positive outcomes. question@nytimes.com C. CLAIBORNE RAY
