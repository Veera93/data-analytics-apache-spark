 It has 414 legs, a pear-shaped head covered with stiff hairs that secrete a silklike substance, a lip with a tooth-lined slit, and two nozzles on each of its 100 segments that give off a defensive poison. Scientists have found a new species of millipede living in a cave in California. They know the single specimen they found is a male, because it has four penises, right below its neck. The animal belongs to the genus Illacme, along with other millipedes, and the researchers gave it the species name tobini, after the biologist Ben Tobin of the National Park Service. “To me, it’s kind of like the exploration of Mars on earth,” said Paul E. Marek, an assistant professor of entomology at Virginia Polytechnic Institute. “These are species that have existed for as long as 100 million years, and we know so little about them.”
