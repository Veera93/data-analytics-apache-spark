 Between 1999 and 2014, drug overdose deaths in the United States nearly tripled. In 2014, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, there were 47,055 deaths from accidental drug overdoses. Opioids were implicated in 28,647 of them, 60.9 percent of the total. From 2014 to 2015, death rates increased by 15.6 percent, and 72.2 percent of deaths were from synthetic opioids, mostly fentanyl and heroin. Deaths from natural and semi-synthetic opioids rose by 2.6 percent, and methadone deaths declined by 9.1 percent. “It’s so rare to see a cause of death increase in the U.S.,” said Dr. Thomas R. Frieden, director of the C.D.C. “Since 2000, more than 300,000 people have died of opiates, and we have yet to see big decreases anywhere.” Morphine and codeine are natural opioids found in the opium poppy. Semi-synthetic opioids like oxycodone, hydrocodone and hydromorphone are derived from them. Many opioids are familiar under brand names — oxycodone is sold as Percocet and Percodan, for example, and hydrocodone as Vicodin. The rate of drug overdose deaths increased in 30 states and in Washington, D.C., and it remained stable in 19 states. In two states, Florida and South Carolina, rates decreased for a time, and then increased again in 2015. Increases from 2014 to 2015 in deaths involving synthetic opioids other than methadone and heroin were highest in the Northeast and lowest in the West. Although death rates among men using these drugs rose more than among women, deaths of women 15 to 24 increased by 116.7 percent, the highest for any sex or age group. The report suggested several steps, including continuing the careful control of opioid prescriptions and intensifying efforts to distribute naloxone, a drug that reverses an opioid overdose.
