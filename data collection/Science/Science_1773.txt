 Thursday night’s Orionid meteor shower will most likely be a bust, thanks to the pesky moon. The Orionids are named because they appear to radiate from the direction of the Orion constellation. But during their peak Thursday night and Friday morning this year, they’re getting upstaged by a brighter neighbor in the sky. “Turns out tonight the moon will park itself very close to the Orionid radiant and completely wash out the Orionid meteors,” said Bill Cooke, an astronomer with NASA’s Meteoroid Environment Office. The moon will be a waning gibbous, which means that more than half of it will be shining. But even if that bright white orb wasn’t masking the show, the shower would probably still be lackluster, according to Dr. Cooke. In recent years the Orionid shower has been pretty weak, showing only between 15 and 20 meteors during the peak. During its most active years, there can be as many as 80 or 90 meteors per hour streaking some 147,000 miles per hour through the atmosphere at the shower’s peak. The Orionids are like the encore performance for Halley’s comet. Every year Earth passes twice through the particles that the dirty snowball left behind during one of its many journeys around the sun. We saw its first performance earlier this year in May with the Eta Aquarids. Despite tonight’s poor meteor shower forecast, you can still attempt to see some cosmic fireworks when the moon checks out right before dawn. “If you can stay up late enough, then you can catch a glimpse of it,” said Jackie Faherty, an astronomer from the American Museum of Natural History. “Or alternatively just get up really, really early before sunrise.” If you don’t see any streaking fireballs tonight, don’t fret too much because in December another shower, the Geminids, is expected to brighten the night sky with between 120 and 160 meteors per hour. So even if the moon is shining, you’ll still get a good show.
