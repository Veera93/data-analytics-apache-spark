 They don’t yet know where they will be going, and they don’t know how they will get there, but they do have a good chance of leaving the planet in the coming years. Last week, NASA announced its 22nd class of astronauts — seven men and five women were chosen from more than 18,300 applicants, the most the space agency has ever received. They range in age from 29 to 42 and include an Army doctor, an engineer at SpaceX and a Massachusetts Institute of Technology professor. • Lt. Kayla Barron, U.S. Navy • Zena Cardman, graduate research fellow, Pennsylvania State University • Lt. Col. Raja Chari, U.S. Air Force • Lt. Cmdr. Matthew Dominick, U.S. Navy • Bob Hines, research pilot, NASA Johnson Space Center • Warren Hoburg, assistant professor, M.I.T. • Jonny Kim, resident physician, Massachusetts General Hospital • Robb Kulin, launch chief engineer, SpaceX • Maj. Jasmin Moghbeli, U.S. Marine Corps • Loral O’Hara, research engineer, Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution • Maj. Frank Rubio, U.S. Army • Jessica Watkins, postdoctoral fellow, Caltech Officially, they are “astronaut candidates” who will now go through two years of training before becoming full-fledged graduates. They will practice for spacewalks in a 60-foot-deep swimming pool at the NASA Johnson Space Center in Houston, learn to fly NASA’s T-38 jet planes and study the ins and outs of the International Space Station. Because Russia is NASA’s main partner on the space station, they will also learn to speak Russian.
