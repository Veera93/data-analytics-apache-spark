 Q. Are people who work with books and manuscripts from the 14th and 15th centuries at risk from disease-causing bacteria or viruses from that time? A. Almost certainly not, because of how diseases spread and how long most microbes can survive on dry surfaces. The disease that springs to mind from outbreaks during that time is bubonic plague. That illness, an infection with the bacterium Yersinia pestis, is very hard to spread even from person to person, unless there is direct contact with liquid bodily secretions. As for other disease-causing bacteria and viruses, many, including some kinds of Enterococcus, Staphylococcus and Streptococcus, can survive outside the body for significant lengths of time on dry surfaces, a systematic review in the journal BMC Infectious Diseases found. But their survival is measured in days, weeks or months, not centuries. One possible exception is anthrax, which forms protective spores that can survive in some cases for decades and perhaps centuries. One researcher speculated that it was the cause of mysterious outbreaks beginning in 1485 of an illness called English sweating sickness. No cases of anthrax transmission by way of medieval manuscripts have been reported, however. question@nytimes.com
