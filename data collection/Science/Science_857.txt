 Q. Let’s say Earth’s orbit moved closer to the sun. How small a change would be disastrous? A. This question hinges on what is meant by “disastrous,” said Jason E. Smerdon, a climate expert at the Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory at Columbia University. If the Earth moves closer to the sun, he said, the planet will receive more solar energy at the top of its atmosphere. This would cause changes in climate. Even our current path is generally thought by scientists to present catastrophic possibilities, including sea-level rise, increases in extreme weather, species extinctions and agricultural disruptions. This is a good threshold definition of “disaster,” Dr. Smerdon said. That scenario presumes a change in the energy balance at the top of the atmosphere of 8.5 watts per meter squared by the year 2100, he added. So what reduction in Earth’s average radial distance to the sun would yield a comparable change in energy? By Dr. Smerdon’s estimate, the current average distance, 92.96 million miles, needs to be reduced by only about three-tenths of a percent for those atmospheric changes to occur. That works out to be 290,000 miles. “That is not much, only about 21 percent larger than the average distance between the Earth and moon.” question@nytimes.com
