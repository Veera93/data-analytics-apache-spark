 MEXICO CITY — Archaeologists have discovered what may be the original structure built at the pyramid of Kukulkan at the Mayan ruins of Chichen Itza. The pyramid was built atop a subterranean river around 900 A.D., and archaeologists have long known that a smaller pyramid lies beneath it. Now scans of the site have detected an even smaller structure inside the “intermediate” pyramid. Archaeologists at Mexico's National Institute of Anthropology and History speculate that the first structure may be in the “pure Maya” style, dating from between 500 A.D. and 800 A.D. (A.P.)
