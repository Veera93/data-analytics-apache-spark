 Q. How does compressed air get compressed? A. The mechanical process is fairly straightforward, beginning with the ancient use of bellows, and was greatly improved around the end of the 18th century, for industrial purposes. It relies on raising the pressure on the air while decreasing the volume of the container in which it is held. Most modern air compression equipment uses a motor-driven piston that moves back and forth and a cylinder with flaplike inlet and discharge valves. As the piston moves out, it makes the space in the cylinder larger and the pressure difference sucks in air through the one-way inlet valve. Then, as the piston moves in, it decreases the space for the air, and the increased pressure forces it through the one-way outlet valve at the new level of pressure. Meanwhile, the inlet valve is held shut. The pressurized air may be moved into a storage tank to stand by until it is needed to do work, like spraying paint. This tank can, of course, take the form of a metal can equipped with a spray valve, making it possible to clean a computer keyboard or remove dust from a camera. question@nytimes.com
