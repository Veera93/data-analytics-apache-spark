 Q. It’s spring and lots of birds are fighting over our solitary birdhouse. Who gets the lease? The first to start a nest? The first to lay eggs? The one who defends it most aggressively? A. “Without knowing which species and where in the country, it is impossible to say,” said Robyn L. Bailey, a wildlife biologist who is leader of the NestWatch Project for the Cornell Lab of Ornithology. “But generally, it is the species that is larger or more aggressive that wins the nest.” Birds that migrate early and start laying their eggs may find their nests overtaken by larger birds that may come back and nest later, Ms. Bailey said. An example would be chickadees, which are in New York year round, versus tree swallows, which migrate a long distance and then try to take over the nesting spot, she said. The tree swallows are not large, but they are larger than chickadees, and will probably prevail. Only a minority of birds are cavity nesters that would compete for a backyard nest box. One very aggressive species that can win out in many cases is the tiny house wren, which starts to nest late, when all the spots are taken. It will actually remove eggs to take over a nest, if it chooses. Although this may seem like an injustice in your own backyard, Ms. Bailey pointed out that house wrens are a legally protected native species and that nature must be allowed to take its course. “If the interloper is a house sparrow, which is not a native species, you can interfere if you want, but be sure you can correctly identify this species before taking action,” she said. Many anecdotal reports of competition for nest boxes can be found on a site maintained by Bet Zimmerman, a longtime advocate for America’s three bluebird species. question@nytimes.com
