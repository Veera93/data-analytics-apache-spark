 The Hawaiian crow has just been inducted into an exclusive club: animals that know how to use tools. The bird, sometimes called the alala, is native to Hawaii but has been extinct in the wild since 2002. Researchers tested 104 of the birds — at the time, only 109 existed in a captive breeding program — and found that by the time they were a year old, 93 percent of them spontaneously used sticks to dig food out of a hole in a log. Most of the birds started using sticks as soon as they were made available, modifying them to make them more efficient and replacing those they found unacceptable. Some crows manufactured their own implements from plant materials. In hopes of re-establishing a wild population, researchers will begin to release some of the more than 130 birds, starting with a dozen in November.
