 Ellen Muller, an underwater photographer and environmentalist, was exploring a site in the National Marine Park of the Caribbean island of Bonaire when she noticed an unusual hermit crab. She collected one and turned it over to Rafael Lemaitre, a zoologist at the National Museum of Natural History in Washington. It turned out to be a previously unknown species, now named Pylopaguropsis mollymullerae, after Ms. Muller’s granddaughter Molly. Its common name is candy-striped hermit crab, so called for its bright red and white bands. Vivid colors are typical of crabs that clean parasites from fish in exchange for protection. Dr. Lemaitre, who published a description of the animal in the journal Zookeys, suggests that it might have a symbiotic relationship with moray eels. One of them was found crawling on a moray, and it seemed to be sharing the eel’s den. The crab, about an inch across, was found living at a depth of 45 feet. Like other hermit crabs, it shelters in the disused shell of another animal, which it carries wherever it goes.
