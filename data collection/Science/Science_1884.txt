 Q. Will someone who wears high-heeled shoes be more likely to suffer deep-vein thrombosis, and perhaps a lethal pulmonary embolism, than a person who wears flats? A. No formal scientific studies have linked high heels with the formation of blood clots deep in the veins and fatal embolisms when such clots travel to the lungs. Most health problems associated with high heels involve the skeleton and foot bones. But there is research suggesting that walking in high heels does impair the working of the muscular pump in the calves that aids the healthy return of blood to the upper body. In a small 2006 study, published in the journal Angiology, the blood pressure of a small sample of people without vein disease was tracked as they stood, flexed their feet and walked on a treadmill, either barefoot or wearing high heels. “The use of high-heeled shoes increases muscular effort during walking and diminishes the leg venous pressure compared with barefooted,” the researchers concluded. A larger study, done in 2012 and published in The Journal of Vascular Surgery, monitored healthy young women walking barefoot and in shoes with various heel heights, up to 2¾ inches. The amount of blood pumped when the subjects were wearing high heels was reduced. The researchers said the results suggested wearing heels could be a factor contributing to various vein problems. question@nytimes.com
