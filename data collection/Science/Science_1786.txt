 Q. I read that Venus is the only planet to rotate clockwise. What dictates the direction of rotation? A. In fact, there are two planets that spin on their axes from east to west. The other is Uranus. The rotation of Venus is very slow, taking a little more than 243 Earth days to make a complete turn, while the planet’s orbit around the sun takes just over 224 days. An explanation for the backward, or retrograde, rotation is not certain. A long-held theory is that Venus once rotated as the other planets do, but was struck billions of years ago by a planet-size object. The impact and its aftermath caused the rotation to change directions or flipped the planetary axis. Another theory is that tidal effects from core-mantle friction and a thick atmosphere might have accounted for the change in direction. A more recent idea, put forth in the journal Nature in 2001, suggests that an initial counterclockwise rotation was an unstable state for various complex reasons and that the planet slowed down and slipped into a more stable state of clockwise rotation. As for the initial direction of rotation for all of the sun’s planets, it is assumed to be a legacy of their formation through a gradual accretion of the whirling original material of the solar system. question@nytimes.com
