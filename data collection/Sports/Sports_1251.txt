 WASHINGTON — Bradley Beal scored 27 points and John Wall added 25 with nine assists as the Washington Wizards defeated the Knicks, 121-103, on Wednesday night at Capital One Arena. Playing for the first time since he was named Eastern Conference Player of the Week, Beal followed his 39-point outburst on Sunday by hitting 11 of his 14 field-goal attempts for the Wizards, who have won five of their last six games. Marcin Gortat had a season-high 21 points, making 9 of 10 shots from the field. Michael Beasley had 20 points, including 16 in the second half to lead the Knicks, who have lost six of seven, and 14 of their last 15 against the Wizards. The loss also dropped the Knicks to 3-13 on the road. Kristaps Porzingis added 16 points for the Knicks (18-20), who also had guard Ron Baker back in the lineup after he missed a game with a left orbital fracture. Baker wore a protective mask that he said he expected to use for at least four weeks. He finished with 4 points in 19 minutes. In an energetic first half that ended with both teams shooting 58.1 percent, Wall’s jumper at the horn gave the Wizards a 64-63 halftime lead. The first seven Washington baskets in the third quarter were from inside, and the resulting 15-3 run gave the Wizards a 79-66 lead with 7 minutes 47 seconds to play in the quarter. The Wizards (22-16) are now 11-10 against sub-.500 teams.
