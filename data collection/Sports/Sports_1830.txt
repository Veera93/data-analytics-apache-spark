 Paris St.-Germain and Bayern Munich were the first teams to clinch a spot in the Champions League knockout rounds after the group rivals both won Tuesday to advance with two games left. P.S.G. routed Anderlecht, 5-0 — with defender Layvin Kurzawa scoring three times to outshine Neymar — and Bayern won 2-1 at Celtic. Manchester United, like P.S.G., won a fourth straight game, but beating Benfica by 2-0 was not yet enough to ensure advancement out of Group A. Roma started early, scoring after 40 seconds in a 3-0 win against Chelsea, helping the Italian team to take the top spot in Group C from Chelsea. Atlético Madrid is still winless after being held 1-1 by visiting Qarabag. Barcelona and Juventus both drew away from home to maintain their steady progress in Group D.
