 Burglars broke into the Florida home of the tennis star Venus Williams, stealing $400,000 worth of items, while she was playing the United States Open this summer, the police said on Thursday. Ms. Williams’s home, a 10,000-square-foot estate in a gated community in Palm Beach Gardens, Fla., was hit at some point between Sept. 1 and Sept. 5, a stretch when she was competing in the tournament in Flushing Meadows Corona Park, Queens. A report by the Palm Beach Gardens Police Department, which released it publicly on Thursday, said the total value of the items stolen was $400,000. It is unclear what exactly was stolen because the police blacked out the portion of the report that listed individual items. From Sept. 1 to Sept. 5, Ms. Williams played several matches at the U.S. Open and advanced to the semifinals, where she lost to the eventual champion, Sloane Stephens. Ms. Williams acquired the Florida property, which backs up to a golf course, nearly two decades ago, according to property records. Palm Beach Gardens in Palm Beach County is home to many professional athletes, including her sister, Serena Williams. The burglary came about three months after Ms. Williams was involved in a fatal car crash near her home. Ms. Williams was driving about 5 miles per hour, according to the police, when her sport utility vehicle collided with another vehicle in an intersection. The police initially said that she was at fault for running a red light but later said that surveillance video showed that Ms. Williams had “lawfully entered” the intersection. A passenger in the other car, Jerome Barson, died two weeks after the crash, and the Barson estate has sued Ms. Williams, claiming she had been negligent. Ms. Williams, 37, has won seven Grand Slam events and is ranked No. 5 in the world.
