 On Sunday, the selection committee set the field for the men’s N.C.A.A. tournament. The four No. 1 seeds, in order, are Virginia, Villanova, Kansas and Xavier. —— Follow our live coverage of March Madness here. —— Need a bracket? Here’s a printable version of N.C.A.A. bracket Need some help? Here’s who the experts pick in the N.C.A.A. tournament. With two fewer losses than any other team in Division I and the esteemed Atlantic Coast Conference’s regular season and tournament championship’s, Virginia (31-2) is the top overall seed in the tournament. NO EASY ROAD FOR VIRGINIA: Coach Tony Bennett’s team lost only two games all season and capped off a fantastic year with the A.C.C. tournament championship on Saturday. They are favorites to reach the Final Four for the first time since 1984. But the committee did not do them many favors in the South region. Cincinnati, the No. 2 seed, boasts the second-ranked defense in the nation (behind the Cavaliers). And then there is Arizona (No. 4 seed) and Kentucky (No. 5), both explosive and talented groups that seem to be peaking at the right time. HOT MATCHUP: Two of the nation’s hottest teams face each other in the first round in the South. Kentucky, winner of the SEC tournament, drew Davidson, winner of the Atlantic-10 conference, in what will most certainly be one of the most anticipated matchups of the week, in Boise, Idaho. UPSET SPECIAL: You could argue that No. 11 Loyola-Chicago had a much easier road to the Missouri Valley Conference title without Wichita State around. But the Ramblers have won 10 in a row. No. 6 Miami, which had been hot before the ACC tournament, better look out. TEXAS SNEAKS IN: After going 11-22 a year ago, the No. 10 Longhorns found themselves on the bubble this season. But the committee gave Coach Shaka Smart another opportunity to make some March magic. Freshman shot-blocking extraordinaire Mo Bamba will be asked to slow down seventh-seeded Nevada, the ninth-most efficient offense in the country. Kansas has the No. 1 seed in the Midwest, and will get to play their first games in Wichita, Kan. But Michigan State, the No. 3 seed, and Duke, the No. 2, loom. REGION OF DEATH: There’s always one. Hard to think that any of the No. 1 seeds drew a tougher path than Kansas, which is actually lower in Ken Pomeroy’s ratings (9th) than two other teams in its own bracket: No. 3 seed Michigan State (6th) and No. 2 seed Duke (3rd). Jayhawks Coach Bill Self says the team played its best game of the season in winning the Big 12 Conference tournament on Saturday. But they could have to contend with a very athletic Auburn team (No. 4 seed), and Clemson (No. 5 seed) which finished fourth in the ACC. SOONER BETTER THAN LATER: Somehow, Oklahoma squeaks in. One of the most befuddling teams in the tournament field (at one point, the Sooners were ranked fourth in the country), they lost 11 of their last 15 games. Freshman guard Trae Young (the nation’s leader in scoring and assists) remains one of the most fun players to watch. But he has not really been the same player since January. UPSET SPECIAL: Not going too far out on a limb here, but No. 9 seed N.C. State should be able to handle eighth-seeded Seton Hall, which has been trending in the wrong direction. The Wolfpack beat Duke and Arizona this season. Villanova, fresh off its second consecutive Big East tournament championship, has earned the No. 1 seed in the East region, which means they could get to play in Boston for a trip to go to the Final Four. They will face the winner of LIU Brooklyn/Radford in the First Four game in Dayton. BETTER WITHOUT BIGGIE: It is hard to believe that a team can lose one of the best players in the nation, and then improve the following season. But that’s exactly what happened to second-seeded Purdue this year, after the power forward Caleb Swanigan, nicknamed “Biggie”, jumped to the pros. Swanigan was the Big Ten’s player of the year, but his absence has allowed the 7-foot-2 center Isaac Haas more freedom to develop. Guards Carsen Edwards and Dakota Matthias are lethal for the second-best 3-point shooting team in the country. The Boilermakers have Final Four ingredients. ROLLIN’ TIDE: Alabama lost 15 games this season, and there were some ugly ones (Central Florida, Vanderbilt, Georgia, Ole Miss). But they have the potential to make some noise in March. Why? Freshman guard Collin Sexton is arguably the best player in the nation: a Russell Westbrook-type talent who won’t be in college basketball for much longer. UPSET SPECIAL: Wichita State is normally the team doing the upsetting. But the Shockers are a No. 4 seed this year, and they drew an unusual matchup in No. 13 Marshall. Under Coach Dan D’Antoni, the Thundering Herd love to push the pace. Wichita could be left gasping. Xavier earned their first No. 1 seed in school history, giving the Big East two of the top seeds in the tournament. They will need to look out for Gonzaga, though, as the No. 4 seed and a possible Round of 16 matchup. North Carolina is the No. 2 seed in the region. WOLVERINES ROARING: Is there a hotter team in the nation than Michigan? Hard to figure. The Wolverines blew through the Big Ten tournament field as a No. 7 seed, and have won 9 of their last 10 games. Young, energetic, and clicking on defense, Michigan, the No. 3 seed, will be a favorite to overtake top seeded Xavier. The question is whether the prolonged layoff after the Big Ten tournament ended a month ago (O.K., it was only a week) will have any impact on the Wolverines’ momentum. DAUM-INATING: Oklahoma’s Trae Young got most of the attention for his scoring this season, but South Dakota State’s Mike Daum had 12 30-plus point performances to go with 10.4 rebounds per game. With Daum leading the way, the Jackrabbits were sixth in the nation in scoring this season. They have never won an N.C.A.A. tournament game (losing to Gonzaga last season) but Ohio State has looked shaky of late. UPSET SPECIAL: Houston had a good run. But they’re not getting past San Diego State, which has won nine in a row, got their senior leader (Trey Kell) back, and led No. 22 Nevada by 30 at halftime on Friday. Georgia’s loss to Kentucky in an S.E.C. tournament quarterfinal ended the Bulldogs’ chances of a tournament bid in advance of Sunday’s selection show, but after the school fired Coach Mark Fox he announced in a news conference on Sunday that his players had decided they would not accept a bid to the N.I.T. if one were offered. Georgia’s spokesman, Mike Mobley, confirmed the school would honor the players’ decision and the team, which went 18-15, is now in search of a new coach. Fox earned two N.C.A.A. tournament bids in his nine years with Georgia, losing in the first round both times. The first four games of the tournament will be held in Dayton, Ohio, on Tuesday and Wednesday. The matchups are as follows: Tuesday: LIU-Brooklyn vs. Radford, 6:40 p.m. Eastern. Followed by St. Bonaventure vs. U.C.L.A., at approximately 9:10 p.m. Wednesday: N.C. Central vs. Texas Southern, 6:40 p.m. Followed by Arizona State vs. Syracuse, at approximately 9:10 p.m. As expected the 68-team field was announced at the beginning of the TBS broadcast.
