 There are fresh fears in Houston that Rockets point guard Chris Paul could be sidelined for a month by a bone bruise in his left knee suffered during the exhibition season, according to two people with direct knowledge of the situation. Paul has been officially ruled out of the Rockets’ home opener Saturday night against the Dallas Mavericks but is likely to be held out for a much longer period, said the people, who requested anonymity because they are not publicly authorized to discuss the player’s health status. Paul bumped knees with Memphis Grizzlies guard Mario Chalmers on Oct. 11 and was forced to sit out Houston’s final exhibition game. The All-Star was then reduced to a spectator for much of crunchtime in Houston’s season-opening win at the Golden State Warriors and held completely out of Houston’s win in Sacramento against the Kings on Wednesday. Paul said this week he would focus on “the big picture” before making his return to the lineup. “It’s not a tear or something like that,” Rockets coach Mike D’Antoni told reporters after the team’s practice Friday. “It’s a bruise. We just have to make sure he’s 100 percent the next time he plays.” Paul, 32, was traded from the Los Angeles Clippers to the Rockets in late June. He pushed for the trade — to team up with fellow All-Star James Harden — rather than becoming a free agent on July 1. To make the trade to Houston happen, Paul had to opt into the final season of his previous contract, valued at $24.6 million, and surrender the security that a lucrative new deal with the Clippers or a new team could have provided.
