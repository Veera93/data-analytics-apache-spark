 FRISCO, Tex. — Dallas Cowboys running back Ezekiel Elliott on Wednesday dropped his appeal of his six-game suspension over allegations of domestic violence. Elliott served the first game of the suspension in Dallas’ loss to the Atlanta Falcons last weekend, so he will sit out the next five games. Elliott’s agents that his decision to end the appeal “is in no way an admission of wrongdoing.” They said Elliott’s decision came from “a practical assessment of the current legal landscape.” Elliott, the N.F.L.’s leading rusher last season, had a hearing at a United States Court of Appeals set for Dec. 1, four games into the suspension. By accepting the six-game penalty, Elliott is set to return for the Cowboys’ final two games of the regular season: Dec. 24 at home against Seattle and Dec. 31 at Philadelphia. Elliott, 22, was suspended in August after the league concluded following a yearlong investigation that he had several physical confrontations in the summer of 2016 with Tiffany Thompson, his girlfriend at the time. Prosecutors in Ohio did not pursue the case. Elliott denied the allegations under oath during his N.F.L. appeal.
