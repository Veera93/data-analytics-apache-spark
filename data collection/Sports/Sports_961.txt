 The American quartet of Chrishuna Williams, Raevyn Rogers, Charlene Lipsey and Ajeé Wilson set a world indoor record in the 4x800-meter relay on Saturday at the 111th Millrose Games in Upper Manhattan. Their time of 8 minutes, 5.89 seconds topped the mark of 8:06:50 set by the Russian team of Aleksandra Bulanova, Ekaterina Sharmina, Elena Kotulskaya and Anna Balakshina on Feb. 18, 2011. Kendra Chambers, Lynsey Sharp, Ce’aira Brown and Cecilia Barowski of the United States finished second in 8:11.45, and the Jamaican team of Fellan Ferguson, Simoya Campbell, Kimarra McDonald and Natoya Goule came in third at 8:17.75. Shaunae Miller-Uibo of the Bahamas, the defending Olympic champion in the 400 meters, ran 35.45 in the Millrose 300 meters to tie the world indoor record set by Russia’s Irina Privalova in 1993. Lolo Jones finished seventh in the women’s 60-meter hurdles. She was clocked in 8.37 seconds, three weeks after she was passed over for a spot on the United States bobsled team for the Pyeongchang Winter Olympics, which begin this week. Jones represented the United States in the 2008 and 2012 Summer Olympics (100-meter hurdles) and in the 2014 Winter Olympics (bobsled). Vashti Cunningham, whose father is the retired N.F.L. quarterback Randall Cunningham, tied a meet record of 1.96 meters in the women’s high jump.
