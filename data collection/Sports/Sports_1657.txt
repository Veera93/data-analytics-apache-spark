 COLUMBUS, Ohio — Sergei Bobrovsky made 36 saves for his 21st career shutout, and Zach Werenski and Artemi Panarin scored in the Columbus Blue Jackets’ 2-0 victory over the New York Rangers on Friday night. New York ran into a hot goalie in Bobrovsky, the reigning Vezina Trophy winner. He notched his second shutout of the season in powering Columbus to its third straight victory. Rangers goalie Henrik Lundqvist was nearly as good against the increasingly aggressive Blue Jackets, stopping 40 shots. The Rangers lost their second straight, following a six-game winning streak. After a scoreless first period in which both goalies made some slick, sprawling saves, Werenski found the back of the net with his sixth goal of the season 13 minutes 34 seconds into the second. Brandon Dubinsky lost the handle of the puck in the slot, and Werenski picked it up just inside the right circle and beat Lundqvist with a one-timer. Panarin scored his fourth goal of the season on a power play 7:14 into the third period, rocketing a slap shot from the high slot that ricocheted off the bar and in.
