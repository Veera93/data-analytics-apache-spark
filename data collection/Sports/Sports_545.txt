 The University of Connecticut is firing Kevin Ollie after six seasons as men’s basketball coach, citing an N.C.A.A. investigation into recruiting violations announced a couple months ago. “It is unfortunate that this decision became necessary,” the university’s athletic director, David Benedict, said in a statement. “As with all of our programs, we hold men’s basketball to the highest standards. We will begin a national search immediately to identify our next head coach.” The university said it was seeking to fire him for cause. Though Ollie’s contract pays him more than $3 million a season, the university may owe him nothing if he is fired with cause, The Hartford Courant reported. Ollie plans to contest the decision to fire him with cause, saying in a statement, “I have always diligently promoted an atmosphere of compliance for all involved in the program,” ESPN reported Saturday night. Ollie played for UConn in the 1990s before a long N.B.A. career. He returned in 2012 to succeed his former coach, Jim Calhoun, who had turned the Huskies’ men’s team into a national program that won three national championships. Ollie led the Huskies to their fourth title in his second season, 2013-14, but has struggled as UConn faces new and geographically disparate rivals in the American Athletic Conference. Since winning the title, the Huskies have made the N.C.A.A. tournament just once, and are coming off their second consecutive losing season.
