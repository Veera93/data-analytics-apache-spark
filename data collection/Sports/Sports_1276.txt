 The Indianapolis Colts fired coach Chuck Pagano on Sunday moments after they closed their 4-12 season with a 22-13 win over the Houston Texans. In seven seasons at the helm of the Colts, Pagano posted a 53-43 record that included an appearance in the 2014 A.F.C. Championship Game. Indianapolis has failed to make the postseason in three straight seasons. “Chuck Pagano provided Colts fans with many exciting wins and memories as head coach of the Colts,” Jim Irsay, the Colts’ owner and chief executive, said in a statement. “Throughout his tenure in Indianapolis, he impacted the lives of the players he coached, those who he worked with in the organization and Colts fans across the globe.”
