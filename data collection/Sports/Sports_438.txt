 The Bill Simmons Media Group and its president, Eric Weinberger, “mutually agreed” to part ways two weeks ago, according to a statement released Tuesday by a company spokesman. The announcement comes three months after Weinberger was suspended and placed on indefinite leave following the filing of a lawsuit by a former NFL Network wardrobe stylist that claimed Weinberger had groped her and sent her lewd text messages, including nude pictures of himself. Weinberger, a former NFL Network executive, left the league-owned media company in 2015 to become president of the Bill Simmons Media Group. He has yet to respond publicly to the allegations set forth in the lawsuit. He did not respond to messages seeking comment on Tuesday. When announcing Weinberger’s suspension in December, a Bill Simmons Media Group spokesman said the company was conducting an “internal investigation” of his behavior. The spokesman declined to comment Tuesday on whether the investigation had been completed, or what it found. The Bill Simmons Media Group, founded by Bill Simmons after ESPN announced in 2015 that it had decided not to extend his contract, in 2015, publishes The Ringer, a sports and culture website, and produces podcasts and documentaries. The wardrobe stylist, Jami Cantor, sued the NFL Network in December. Subsequently, ESPN fired two former football players turned analysts, Donovan McNabb and Eric Davis, who were named in the lawsuit. Three current NFL Network analysts, Marshall Faulk, Heath Evans and Ike Taylor, remain suspended amid an ongoing investigation. Warren Sapp, who was also accused of harassment, had previously been fired by the NFL Network in 2015 after his arrest on suspicion of assault and soliciting prostitution. Separately, another NFL Network executive, David Eaton, resigned in December after his history of sending sexually explicit tweets was reported.
