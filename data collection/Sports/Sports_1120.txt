 SUNRISE, Fla. — Jets wide receiver Robby Anderson faces several criminal charges in Florida after being accused of threatening a police officer and his family and of saying he would rape the officer’s wife. A Sunrise police report said Anderson, 24, was stopped early Friday in a sport utility vehicle after it ran two red lights and was swerving while traveling about 105 m.p.h. It is Anderson’s second arrest in the last eight months. He also faces a charge of resisting arrest in Miami. “This is a pending legal matter, and we will have no further comments,” the Jets said in a statement. The N.F.L. spokesman Brian McCarthy said, “We will be looking into this matter.” After Anderson was stopped, the police said, he made the threats and then boasted about how much money he had. Jail records show Anderson faces nine charges, including threatening harm to a public servant, resisting arrest and traffic violations. A 2011 graduate of South Plantation High School in Florida, Anderson caught 63 passes for 941 yards and seven touchdowns this season with the Jets.
