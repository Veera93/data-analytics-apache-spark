 MINNEAPOLIS — The hard-hitting linebackers Ray Lewis and Brian Urlacher and the big-play receiver Randy Moss each made the Pro Football Hall of Fame on his first try, while the receiver Terrell Owens got in on his third time on the ballot. Safety Brian Dawkins, in his second year of eligibility, also was chosen by the Hall of Fame voters on Saturday. Those five were the modern-day player selections in an eight-person class that also included the executive Bobby Beathard and two nominees chosen by the Seniors Committee, the former Green Bay Packers lineman Jerry Kramer and the former Houston Oilers linebacker Robert Brazile. Lewis and Urlacher helped define the middle linebacker position in their era. Lewis won two Associated Press Defensive Player of the Year awards and one Super Bowl Most Valuable Player Award for the Baltimore Ravens, and Urlacher won a Defensive Player of the Year award, too. Moss and Owens were two of the most dynamic receivers of their time, but also lightning rods because of a periodic inability to get along well with teammates and coaches. Each played for five teams in his career. Moss, who is fourth in career N.F.L. receiving yards, became the first receiver since Jerry Rice to be chosen for the Hall on his first ballot appearance. Owens finished No. 2 in career receiving yards — behind Rice, who was an Owens teammate with the San Francisco 49ers. His wait to be elected to the Hall stirred up concerns that he was being unfairly penalized for personality squabbles and extravagant touchdown celebrations. The induction ceremony will be held in August in Canton, Ohio.
