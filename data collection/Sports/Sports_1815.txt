 The Houston Astros won their first World Series on Wednesday night by defeating the Los Angeles Dodgers, 5-1, in Game 7, but it was far from the city’s first sports championship. Teams from Houston have won titles in basketball, football, soccer, hockey … and even baseball.  Here’s a look at championship teams Houston has celebrated. Champions: The Rockets won titles in 1994, led by Hakeem Olajuwon, and in 1995, behind Olajuwon and the newly acquired Clyde Drexler.  That 1994 championship, Chicago Bulls fans might point out, occurred at the end of a season that Michael Jordan skipped to play minor league baseball. He missed most of the next season, too, when the Rockets won again.  But Rockets fans, however, could respond that in the 1994 playoffs Houston eliminated teams led by several Hall of Famers: Drexler, with the Portland Trail Blazers; Charles Barkley, with the Phoenix Suns; Karl Malone and John Stockton, with the Utah Jazz; and Patrick Ewing, with the Knicks. And in 1995 the Rockets knocked out Utah, Phoenix, the San Antonio Spurs (led by David Robinson and Dennis Rodman) and the Orlando Magic (who had Shaquille O’Neal). And since? Houston has had only three losing records since 1995, but has never been back to the finals. Champions: The Comets won the league’s first four titles, in 1997, 1998, 1999 and 2000, and they did it with star power: Cynthia Cooper, Sheryl Swoopes and Tina Thompson. In the 1998 regular season, the Comets went 27-3. Their winning percentage, .900, remains a W.N.B.A. record.  And since? After Cooper’s retirement and an injury to Swoopes in the early 2000s, the Comets never returned to the finals. After lackluster seasons from 2004-8, the Comets were put up for sale. No new owner stepped up, and the players were made available in a dispersal draft. Champions: The Oilers won the first two A.F.L. titles, in the 1960 and 1961 seasons, with George Blanda, a lanky quarterback in his mid-30s who had come out of retirement, and Charlie Tolar, a 5-foot-6 fullback nicknamed the Human Bowling Ball. And since? The Oilers lost in the A.F.L. championship game in 1962 and 1967. Houston joined the N.F.L. as part of the leagues’ 1970 merger and reached the A.F.C. championship game twice. Houston moved to Nashville in 1997, becoming the Tennessee Titans, who lost the 2000 Super Bowl, 23-16, when receiver Kevin Dyson was tackled a yard short of scoring a touchdown on the final play of the game. Champions: Like the Oilers and the Comets, the Dynamo entered their league by winning championships, in the 2006 and 2007 M.L.S. Cups. And now? The Dynamo finished first in the Western Conference in 2008, and lost to the Los Angeles Galaxy in the M.L.S. Cup in both 2011 and 2012. After three years of missing the playoffs, the Dynamo are playing this season in the Western Conference semifinals.  Champions: The Houston team was born as the Dayton Arrows, but never played in Dayton and wound up in Houston’s bigger market instead. The team was the W.H.A. champion in 1974 and ’75 as the Aeros, hoisting the Avco World Trophy. It helped to have the ageless Gordie Howe, who played his first game for the Aeros at 45, and his two sons, Mark and Marty. And since? The Aeros went under after the 1977-78 season, and the W.H.A. followed suit the next year. Gordie Howe, known as Mr. Hockey, played until he was 51 and died in 2016. Champion: Rice University won 30 games in a row early in the 2003 season and then won the College World Series, and pitching was a major reason. Its three primary starting pitchers — Philip Humber, Jeff Niemann and Wade Townsend — were all selected within the first eight picks of the 2004 major league draft. And the team’s top reliever, David Aardsma, was drafted in the first round in 2003. Rice defeated Stanford in the 2003 College World Series best-of-three final for the university’s first national championship. And since? The Owls have made 23 consecutive appearances in the N.C.A.A. tournament but have not reached the College World Series since 2008. Champion: Your memory may say that the University of Houston’s Phi Slama Jama teams with Drexler and Olajuwon won an N.C.A.A. title, but they didn’t. Their claim to fame was losing the 1983 championship game, to North Carolina State, resulting in the highlights-forever footage of North Carolina State Coach Jim Valvano running around looking for someone to hug. But another Houston team, Texas Southern, won the 1977 small-college National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics title with a future pro of its own in Alonzo Bradley, who played 99 games in the N.B.A. with the Rockets. And since? Texas Southern eventually moved into N.C.A.A. Division I and has played in the N.C.A.A. men’s tournament seven times. The Tigers have yet to win an N.C.A.A. tournament game. Champions: The University of Houston was the U.C.L.A. of men’s golf, winning 16 titles in 30 years: in 1956, 1957, 1958, 1959, 1960, 1962, 1964, 1965, 1966, 1967, 1969, 1970, 1977, 1982, 1984 and 1985. Team members who became PGA Tour regulars include Fred Couples, Fuzzy Zoeller, Bruce Lietzke, John Mahaffey, Kermit Zarley, Steve Elkington, Blaine McCallister, Bill Rogers and Ray Brown. And since? The Cougars have not won since 1985, when Brown was an all-American for the fourth year in a row, and they missed the N.C.A.A. tournament in 2016.
