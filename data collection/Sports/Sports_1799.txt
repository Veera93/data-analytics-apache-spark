 The 2017 Breeders’ Cup World Championships is thoroughbred racing’s year-end championship and gets a glamorous sheen this year as it is held for the first time at Del Mar, an oceanside racetrack in Southern California founded by Bing Crosby who gave it a song, “Where the Turf Meets the Surf.” The two day, 13-race program, which starts Friday, brings some of the best horses in the world to compete at a variety of distances and surfaces. Gun Runner and Arrogate headline the Breeders’ Cup Classic, and whoever wins the Juvenile automatically becomes the favorite for next year’s Kentucky Derby. How to watch: NBC Sports Network will broadcast Friday’s races, from 5 p.m. to 8 p.m. Eastern, and Saturday’s races, from 1:30 p.m. to 8 p.m., before NBC picks up the coverage for the Classic, from 8 p.m. to 9 p.m. Coverage will also be streamed on NBC Sports Live. Here are our picks for some of the key races on Saturday The morning-line odds were set by Russ Hudak of Del Mar. Purse: $6,000,000 Distance: 1¼ miles Age: 3 years old and older Post time: 8:35 p.m. Eastern Joe Drape’s picks: 5. Gun Runner (9-5) has done what the very good one’s do: He goes out fast and dares someone to catch him. 7. Churchill (15-1) is trying dirt for the first time after running with the best Europe has to offer and winning 7 of twelve. Why not here? 6. Mubtaahij (12-1) is a world traveling horse that will be flying down the lane. Victor Mather’s picks: 5. Gun Runner has been stomping everyone in the East. 1. Arrogate (2-1), the defending champ, won seven in a row capped by the Dubai World Cup, but hasn’t really sparkled since. 11. Collected (6-1) upset Arrogate last time after dominating lesser competition. Purse: $4 million Distance: 1½ miles, grass Age: 3 and older Post time: 7:37 p.m. JD: 5. Ulysses (7-2) ran an impressive third in the Prix de l’Arc de Triomphe. He finds the winner’s circle today. 1. Talismanic (15-1) will find this race easier after knocking heads with the best in France. 4. Decorated Knight (15-1) rounds out the all Euro trifecta. VM: 5. Ulysses has two Group 1 victories and is the best of the Europeans. 12. Beach Patrol (4-1) beat a strong field impressively in the Turf Classic at Belmont. 11. Hunt (15-1) was a bust in his last race, but before that he was California’s best, with two big wins at this track. Purse: $2 million Distance: 1 1/16 miles Age: 2 year olds Post time: 6:58 p.m. JD: 2. Solomini (6-1) ran a distant second to the favorite, but Bob Baffert has his 2-year-olds ready to run. 11. Bolt d’Oro (9-5) is undefeated — otherwise perfect, except for the price. 9. Hazit (20-1) is a son of War Front will relish the extra distance. VM: 11. Bolt d’Oro (9-5) blew away a Grade 1 field at Santa Anita in September. He is faster than the rest. 6. Good Magic (8-1) barely got caught in the Champagne in New York and could improve. 3. Firenze Fire (6-1) won the Champagne, but benefited from a fast pace that day. Purse: $2 million Distance: 1 mile, grass Age: 3 and older Post time: 6:19 p.m. JD: 12. Roly Poly (6-1) is 3-year-old filly that has been pointed to this race by Europe’s finest trainer. 10. Ribchester (7-2) was upset last time as the favorite. He is one of Europe’s best, but may be out of gas. 11, Ballagh Rocks (12-1) just missed last month in the Shadwell Mile. He is sitting on a big one. VM: 10. Ribchester has turned in smashing performances in top-classes races in Britain and France. As long as he tolerates the travel to California, he’s the best. 12. Roly Poly is another fine European runner, but has to be ranked one notch below. 5. World Approval (9-2) is the best of the North Americans and has looked sharp in two straight Grade 1 wins.
