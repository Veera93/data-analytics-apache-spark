 The Rangers traded defenseman Nick Holden to the Boston Bruins on Tuesday for a minor league defenseman and a third-round pick in the 2018 draft. Holden skated in 135 games with the Rangers over parts of two seasons (2016-17 and 2017-18). He had 14 goals and 32 assists for 46 points, along with 49 penalty minutes. He will be an unrestricted free agent after this season. The Rangers received defenseman Rob O’Gara in the deal with the Bruins, who are in a tight race with the Tampa Bay Lightning for first place in the Atlantic Division. The Rangers might deal other players, with forward Rick Nash and defenseman Ryan McDonagh as prime possibilities, before Monday’s trade deadline. They have seven picks for the 2018 draft.
