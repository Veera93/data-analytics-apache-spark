 BRIDGEVIEW, Ill. — Bradley Wright-Phillips and Sacha Kljestan scored four minutes apart early in the first half, and the Red Bulls cruised past the Chicago Fire, 4-0, on Wednesday night in a knockout-round game. The Red Bulls (15-12-8), in their eighth straight playoffs, advanced to the Eastern Conference semifinals against Toronto F.C., which won the Supporters Shield for the league’s best regular season record. Wright-Phillips opened the scoring in the seventh minute with his eighth career playoff goal. Damien Perrinelle chipped the defense to find Wright-Phillips, who settled it and tapped it into an empty net as goalkeeper Matt Lampson misplayed it. Kljestan scored his third goal of the season in the 11th minute with an easy redirection of Tyler Adams’s cross into the 6-yard box. Daniel Royer made it 3-0 in the 70th on a give-and-go with Sean Davis, and Gonzalo Veron, a second-half substitute, chipped a ball over Lampson on a fast break in the 87th to cap the scoring. Luis Robles only needed four saves to keep the Golden Boot winner Nemanja Nikolic and Chicago (16-12-7) scoreless. The Red Bulls entered with only one win in their last seven road games.
