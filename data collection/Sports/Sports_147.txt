 DeMar DeRozan scored 37 points to match his career high in the playoffs, Jonas Valanciunas had 19 points and 14 rebounds and the Toronto Raptors beat the visiting Washington Wizards, 130-119, on Tuesday night. The victory gave the Raptors a 2-0 lead in a playoff series for the first time in franchise history. Kyle Lowry had 13 points and a career playoff-high 12 assists for Toronto, which had ended an N.B.A.-worst 10-game losing streak in Game 1s with a 114-106 win on Saturday. The Raptors, who made a team playoff record 16 3-pointers Saturday, connected on 12 of 32 from long range on Tuesday, making only one 3-pointer in the second half. John Wall scored 29 points, Mike Scott had 20 and Ty Lawson 14 for the Wizards, who host Game 3 on Friday night. Wizards guard Bradley Beal missed 8 of 11 shots and finished with 9 points. Beal had more fouls in the first half (three) than made baskets (two). The Wizards cut a 100-90 deficit with 7 minutes 52 seconds left to 108-103 on back-to-back 3-pointers by Scott and Lawson, and a pair of free throws from Wall. But Miles stopped the run with a long 3, Torontoâ€™s only one of the second half, and the Raptors put it away with a 17-4 spurt over the next four minutes. The capacity crowd roared when DeRozan forced a turnover and saved the ball from going out of bounds, then passed to Lowry who fed Wright for an alley-oop dunk with 3:38 left, putting Toronto up, 125-107. Raptors guard Fred VanVleet returned after sitting out Game 1 because of a bruised right shoulder, but looked rusty in three minutes of action at the start of the second quarter, airballing a shot and mishandling a pass before being replaced by Lowry. VanVleet did not play in the second half. CELTICS 120, BUCKS 106 Jaylen Brown had a playoff career-high 30 points and host Boston pulled away in the second half to take a 2-0 series lead over Milwaukee. Terry Rozier added 23 points for Boston, which led by as many as 20 in the fourth quarter. Game 3 will be Friday in Milwaukee. The Bucks got as close as 107-97 with 4:13 to play. But the Celtics responded with an 11-2 run, capped by a banked in 3-pointer by Brown to push their lead back up to 118-99. Giannis Antetokounmpo finished with 30 points, 9 rebounds and 8 assists for Milwaukee. Turnovers were an issue for the second straight game for the Bucks. They finished with 15, leading to 21 points by the Celtics. The Bucks also shot only 41 percent (7 of 17) from the free-throw line.
