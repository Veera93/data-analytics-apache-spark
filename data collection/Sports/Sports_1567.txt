 LOS ANGELES — Blake Griffin has a sprained left knee and could miss up to eight weeks, sidelining another key player for the injury-riddled Los Angeles Clippers. The team said Tuesday that a magnetic resonance imaging test revealed a medial collateral ligament sprain, but there is no other structural damage to the knee. Griffin was injured late in Monday night’s 120-115 victory against the Lakers. He had 26 points and 11 rebounds as the Clippers won their third consecutive game. He was going for a loose ball in the paint with teammate Austin Rivers and the Lakers rookie Lonzo Ball. It appeared Rivers fell on Griffin, whose knee got twisted as he landed on his back. Griffin got up, but soon left the game. It was the latest setback for the Clippers, who are 8-11 and in second in the Pacific Division. They are already missing guard Patrick Beverley, who is out for the season after having surgery on his right knee last week. He was acquired after All-Star guard Chris Paul left for Houston. Forward Danilo Gallinari and guard Milos Teodosic are hurt, too. The team, which did not practice Tuesday, will host Utah on Thursday. Griffin did not speak to reporters after Monday’s victory and left the locker room looking grim. His career has been interrupted by injuries, including last season when he was knocked out of the playoffs after having surgery to repair an injury to his right big toe. He averaged 21.6 points, 8.1 rebounds and 4.9 assists in 61 regular-season games. Griffin could have opted out of his contract last summer, but decided to stay with the Clippers only to watch Paul leave. In January 2016, Griffin punched the team’s former equipment manager, breaking his right hand in the process. He was suspended four games and docked nearly $860,000 in pay. Also during the 2015-16 season, he was limited to 35 games because of a left quadriceps injury. He averaged 21.4 points and 8.4 rebounds. The Clippers lost to Portland in the first round of the playoffs.
