 Kristaps Porzingis had 30 points and 9 rebounds, and the Knicks defeated beat the Brooklyn Nets, 107-86, on Friday night at Madison Square Garden for their first victory of the season. The rookie guard Frank Ntilikina scored his first N.B.A. points and finished with 9 as the Knicks became the last team in the league to get a win this season. They did it with a surprisingly strong defensive effort that shut down the league’s highest-scoring team, holding the Nets about 35 points below their average. The Knicks blew the game open with a 25-6 run in the third quarter that turned a 3-point lead into a 72-50 cushion. D’Angelo Russell returned from a one-game absence to score 15 points for the Nets, who looked nothing like the team that beat Eastern Conference champion Cleveland two nights earlier. They came in averaging 121.2 points and had reached 110 in each of their first five games, but shot only 40.5 percent from the field. Knicks Coach Jeff Hornacek gave the veteran Jarrett Jack his first start at point guard and he responded with 8 points, 7 rebounds and 5 assists. Ntilikina, the French guard who has been injured for much of the time since the former president Phil Jackson took him as the No. 8 pick in the draft, then collected the backup minutes and played well. Ntilikina, who missed the previous two games with a sprained left ankle after a scoreless N.B.A. debut, made a long jumper with 49 seconds left in the third quarter. Russell got the first basket of the third quarter to cut the Knicks lead to 3, but they controlled the next seven minutes of play. Porzingis had a follow dunk and 3-point play as he and Enes Kanter combined for all the points in a 9-0 run. Soon after, a 12-2 spurt extended the lead to 72-50.
