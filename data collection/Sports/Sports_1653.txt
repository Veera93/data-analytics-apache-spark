 The Yankees interviewed the Los Angeles Dodgers’ third-base coach, Chris Woodward, for their manager’s job on Saturday. Woodward, a 54th-round draft pick in 1994, spent parts of 12 seasons in the major leagues as a utility infielder, including 2005 and 2006 with the Mets. Woodward, 41, managed New Zealand during qualifying stages for the 2017 World Baseball Classic. He was the fifth candidate to interview for the job.
