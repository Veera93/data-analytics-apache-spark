 The Major League Baseball seasons begins on Thursday, with six new managers at the helm, a pair of notable position changes and several milestones within reach. Here’s a look at what to expect this season:  2,968 — The Angels’ Albert Pujols, with 614 career home runs, would join Willie Mays, Hank Aaron and Alex Rodriguez as the only players in history with 600 home runs and 3,000 hits. 2,376 — Robinson Cano, Seattle 1,986 — Joe Mauer, Minnesota 348 — Edwin Encarnacion, Cleveland 277 — Jay Bruce, Mets 267 — Giancarlo Stanton, Yankees 267 — Chris Davis, Baltimore 1,918 — Albert Pujols, Los Angeles Angels 394 — Dustin Pedroia, Boston 378 — Ian Kinsler, Los Angeles Angels 96 — Ichiro Suzuki, Seattle 3,985 — Ichiro Suzuki, Seattle 3,857 — Robinson Cano, Seattle 996 — Joey Votto, Cincinnati —— 237 — C.C. Sabathia, Yankees 188 — Justin Verlander, Houston 2,846 — C.C. Sabathia, Yankees 2,416 — Justin Verlander, Houston 2,342 — Felix Hernandez, Seattle 385 — Justin Verlander, Houston 381 — Zack Greinke, Arizona 1,935 — Clayton Kershaw, Los Angeles Dodgers 1,897 — Max Scherzer, Washington 1,892 — Adam Wainwright, St. Louis Jake Arrieta, pitcher, Philadelphia (from Chicago Cubs) Yu Darvish, pitcher, Chicago Cubs (from Los Angeles Dodgers) Carlos Santana, first baseman, Philadelphia (from Cleveland) Eric Hosmer, first baseman, San Diego (from Kansas City) Evan Longoria, third baseman, San Francisco (from Tampa Bay) Giancarlo Stanton, outfielder, Yankees (from Miami) Andrew McCutchen, outfielder, San Francisco (from Pittsburgh) Marcell Ozuna, outfielder, St. Louis (from Miami) Dee Gordon, outfielder, Seattle (from Miami) Christian Yelich, outfielder, Milwaukee (from Miami) J.D. Martinez, outfielder, Boston (from Arizona) Aaron Boone, Yankees Mickey Callaway, Mets Dave Martinez, Washington Gabe Kapler, Philadelphia Alex Cora, Boston Ron Gardenhire, Detroit Manny Machado, Baltimore — from third base to shortstop After spending most of his career at third base and winning three Gold Glove awards, Machado will move to shortstop, a position he played in the minors. When shortstop J.J. Hardy was out with an injury in 2016, Machado started 43 games at short, but only played third base last season. The only player to win Gold Gloves at two infield positions is Placido Polanco, who won at second base (2007, 2009) and third base (2011). Dee Gordon, Seattle — from second base to center field After starting 502 games at second base (and 149 at short) during his career with the Los Angeles Dodgers and the Miami Marlins, Gordon is making the move to the outfield. He is a two-time National League All-Star with a Gold Glove with the Marlins in 2015, but Seattle is set at second base with Robinson Cano. The only player to win Gold Gloves as an infielder and outfielder is Darin Erstad, who won Gold Gloves as an outfielder in 2000 and 2002 and as a first baseman in 2004, all with the Anaheim Angels. Jose Altuve, Houston — Four consecutive seasons with 200 base hits. From 2014 through 2017, Altuve has collected 845 hits; Charlie Blackmon of the Colorado Rockies is second with 747. Altuve has also stolen at least 30 bases six straight seasons. Edwin Encarnacion, Cleveland — Six consecutive seasons with 30 home runs. He has the most home runs in baseball, 231, during that stretch. Nolan Arenado, Colorado — Three consecutive seasons with at least 35 home runs, 130 runs batted in and 350 totals bases. Max Scherzer, Washington — Six straight seasons with 200 strikeouts, and five consecutive seasons with 200 innings pitched. Chris Sale, Boston — Five consecutive seasons with 200 strikeouts. Jeff Samardzija, San Francisco — Five straight seasons with 200 innings pitched. With the acquisition of Giancarlo Stanton, the Yankees now have the only two players who hit at least 50 home runs last season in their lineup. Aaron Judge became the first rookie to hit 50 (he finished with 52), and Stanton led the majors with 59 as a Miami Marlin. Only five times have teammates each hit more than 45 home runs in the same season: 1961 Yankees: Roger Maris (61 home runs) and Mickey Mantle (54) 1927 Yankees: Babe Ruth (60) and Lou Gehrig (47) 1931 Yankees: Babe Ruth and Lou Gehrig (46) 2001 Texas Rangers: Alex Rodriguez (52) and Rafael Palmeiro (47) 2005 Boston Red Sox: David Ortiz (47) and Manny Ramirez (45) The Seattle Mariners have not made the playoffs since 2001, the longest postseason drought in the majors. The 2001 Mariners went 116-46, tying the major league record for victories with the 1906 Chicago Cubs. Ichiro Suzuki was a rookie. (He is back with Seattle this season at the age of 44.) Jamie Moyer won 20 games at the age of 38. Second baseman Bret Boone drove in 141 runs. Kazuhiro Sasaki picked up 45 saves.
