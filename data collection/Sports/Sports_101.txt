 LeBron James scored 32 points and combined with Kyle Korver for all but 2 of Cleveland’s final 13 points as the visiting Cavaliers escaped with a 104-100 victory over the Indiana Pacers on Sunday to even the teams’ first-round series at two games apiece. James added 13 rebounds and 7 assists in his 100th career playoff game with 30 or more points. Korver made four 3-pointers and wound up with 18 points. Domantas Sabonis scored 19 points for Indiana, the Eastern Conference’s fifth seed. Myles Turner and Victor Oladipo each scored 17, though Oladipo struggled through a poor shooting night. The game looked and felt a lot like the three previous games — tough, physical and down to the wire. The Pacers led by 93-91 with 4 minutes 28 seconds to go, but they managed only four baskets the rest of the way. James and Korver led a 10-2 run that gave the fourth-seeded Cavaliers a 101-95 lead with 1:52 left. The Pacers could not get closer than 3 the rest of the way. Game 5 will be Wednesday night in Cleveland. BUCKS 104, CELTICS 102 After seeing a 20-point second-half lead slip away, Giannis Antetokounmpo made a huge play with five seconds remaining to save Milwaukee from a devastating loss. The 6-foot-11 Antetokounmpo was in perfect position to reach over Boston’s Jayson Tatum and tip in the go-ahead basket after a miss by Malcolm Brogdon, lifting the Bucks to a home win that tied their first-round series with the Celtics at two games each. “It’s a heck of play,” Bucks Coach Joe Prunty said. Antetokounmpo finished with 27 points, and Khris Middleton added 23. Middleton also played tight defense during Boston’s final possession, forcing Marcus Morris to miss a 14-footer at the buzzer. Game 5 is set for Tuesday night in Boston. The seventh-seeded Bucks set a franchise playoff record with 14 blocks, eclipsing the previous high of 13 set in Game 3, and their reinvigorated bench outscored the Celtics’ reserves, 31-15. Jaylen Brown had 34 points to lead second-seeded Boston. Tatum, who finished with 21, made an 18-footer with 52 seconds left to give the Celtics a brief 100-99 lead. He just could not hold off Antetokounmpo on the other end for the decisive tip-in. The disappointing end for the Celtics overshadowed their spirited comeback from a 65-45 third-quarter deficit. WIZARDS 106, RAPTORS 98 John Wall took over down the stretch after Bradley Beal fouled out, having a hand in 10 of Washington’s last 14 points and finishing with 27 points and 14 assists as the host Wizards came back to beat top-seeded Toronto and even their series at 2-2. The game was tied, 92-92, with about five minutes left when Beal — who led eighth-seeded Washington with 31 points — was called for his sixth foul as he and DeMar DeRozan collided while the Raptors had the ball. Beal raced along the sideline, put his hands on his head, then returned to the Wizards’ bench area and threw a towel before being restrained by teammates. The Raptors went up by 2, but Wall pulled the Wizards even with a layup that drew a goaltending call, then put them in front to stay by feeding Markieff Morris for another layup. Toronto will host Game 5 on Wednesday. DeRozan started 0 for 6 from the field, but he finished with 35 points, 6 rebounds and 6 assists. The Wizards won their eighth consecutive playoff home game. SPURS 103, WARRIORS 90 Manu Ginobili scored 10 of his 16 points in the fourth quarter of what could have been his final home game with the Spurs, and San Antonio defeated Golden State to avoid a series sweep. LaMarcus Aldridge had 22 points and 10 rebounds to lead the Spurs, but they were willed to the finish by Ginobili, 40, who has said he will decide in the off-season whether he will return for a 17th season. Kevin Durant finished with 34 points and 13 rebounds for the second-seeded Warriors, who can wrap up the first-round series in Game 5 at home on Tuesday. Seventh-seeded San Antonio was again without Coach Gregg Popovich, whose wife, Erin, died on Wednesday. His lead assistant, Ettore Messina, coached the Spurs again, but to a much better result than they had in Game 3.
