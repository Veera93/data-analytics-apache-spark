 Throughout much of his second-half funk, Aaron Judge was repeatedly asked if his left shoulder — which was routinely packed in ice after games — was bothering him. The answer from Judge, the Yankees right fielder, was always the same: No. But it appears it had been bothering Judge more than he let on, as he had arthroscopic surgery on Tuesday to remove loose bodies and clean up torn cartilage in his non-throwing shoulder. The surgery, performed by the Los Angeles Dodgers team physician, Neal ElAttrache, is not expected to prevent Judge from being ready for the start of spring training, the Yankees said in a statement. In a nearly two-month span, from the All-Star break through Sept. 2, Judge batted only .176 with 70 strikeouts in 199 plate appearances. On Aug. 30, with persistent questions about the condition of Judge’s shoulder, Manager Joe Girardi said the team and Judge had discussed the possibility of Judge getting a cortisone shot. Shortly after that, Judge regained the form that made him a runner-up to American League most valuable player Jose Altuve, hitting .329 with 15 home runs over his final 25 games in the regular season. The Yankees never said whether Judge took a cortisone shot. In the playoffs, the same shoulder took a blow when Judge crashed into the right-field wall to steal an extra-base hit from Houston Astros first baseman Yulieski Gurriel in Game 3 of the American League Championship Series. Judge tumbled to the ground after colliding with the wall.
