 To help fill the coaching staff of  new manager Mickey Callaway, the Mets promoted Pat Roessler to make him the team’s new hitting coach, a person in baseball familiar with the situation confirmed. The person did not want to be publicly identified because the move was not yet official. Roessler, 57, had been the Mets’ assistant hitting coach since the start of the 2015 season. He is a longtime hitting instructor who has held similar positions in other organizations, and had strong relationships with various Mets players. He succeeded Kevin Long, the Mets’ hitting coach for the past three seasons, who, along with Roessler, helped Daniel Murphy develop into an elite hitter. Long had his sights set on the Mets’ managerial job that went to Callaway last month. The Mets had hoped that Long would still remain in the organization, but he had drawn interest for other hitting-coach positions and managerial vacancies, including the job in Washington. (That ultimately went to Dave Martinez.) Ricky Bones is expected to remain as the Mets’ bullpen coach, while Dave Eiland, a former Yankees and Kansas City Royals pitching coach, is reportedly the Mets’ choice to fill that role for them.
