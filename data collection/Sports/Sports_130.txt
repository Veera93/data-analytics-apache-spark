 The 2018 N.F.L. season will begin with the defending champion Philadelphia Eagles taking on one of the teams they beat on the way to the Super Bowl, as they host the Atlanta Falcons on Thursday, Sept. 6 in prime time on NBC. [Here’s the 2018 N.F.L. schedule] The Eagles beat the Falcons, 15-10, in the N.F.C. divisional round. It is still unknown if Carson Wentz, who tore his anterior cruciate ligament last December, will be sufficiently recovered for the season opener, meaning Nick Foles, who took over and led the Eagles to the championship, could continue to guide the team in his absence. Other highlights of the 2018 schedule, which was released Thursday night, include Jon Gruden making his return to Monday Night Football as a coach rather than a broadcaster when his Oakland Raiders host the Los Angeles Rams on Sept. 10; and a game between the Kansas City Chiefs and the Rams to be played in Mexico City on Nov. 19, also a Monday night. There will be three games played in London. The Raiders will play the Seattle Seahawks at Tottenham Hotspur’s new stadium in London on Oct. 14. The Los Angeles Chargers will play the Tennessee Titans at Wembley Stadium, also in London, on Oct. 21, and the next week the Eagles will be there to play the Jacksonville Jaguars, also at Wembley. There will be no Super Bowl rematch during the regular season, as the Eagles are not in line to play teams from the A.F.C. East this year, but Philadelphia will have a rematch of the N.F.C championship game with the Minnesota Vikings on Oct. 7, and the New England Patriots will have a rematch of the A.F.C. championship game against the Jacksonville Jaguars on Sept. 16.
