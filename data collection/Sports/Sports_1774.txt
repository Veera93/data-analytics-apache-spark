 Kristaps Porzingis scored a career-high 40 points, carrying the Knicks back from a 19-point deficit to a 108-101 victory over the Indiana Pacers on Sunday night at Madison Square Garden. Porzingis added eight rebounds and six blocked shots in his seventh 30-point performance in nine games this season. The rookie Frank Ntilikina made the tiebreaking 3-pointer with 1 minute 34 seconds remaining as the Knicks won for the fifth time in six games after an 0-3 start. He had 10 points and 7 assists off the bench. Tim Hardaway Jr. added 16 points. Thaddeus Young scored 18 points and Victor Oladipo 17 for the Pacers, who led by 84-65 with less than two minutes remaining in the third quarter. Porzingis, who played after having tweaked his left ankle in a 37-point performance Friday night, reeled off 9 straight points that made it 84-74 in the opening seconds of the fourth. He scored 24 points over the game’s final 13 minutes. After Ntilikina’s 3-pointer made it 102-99, Knicks center Enes Kanter picked up a bad pass by Darren Collison and fed Hardaway for a layup that made it 104-99 with 1:10 to go. Oladipo cut the deficit to 104-101 with 32 seconds left, but Lance Thomas’s two free throws made it 106-101 to seal the comeback win with 11.9 seconds to play. Myles Turner added 15 points and Collison 15 points and 10 assists for the Pacers, who have lost two straight. Pacers forward T. J. Leaf, who sprained his left ankle during Friday night’s game in Philadelphia, did not play. Domantas Sabonis had 16 points off the bench. Kanter grabbed 18 rebounds for the Knicks, who improved to 3-1 during their five-game homestand, which equals their longest of the season. They have two more home stretches of five games later in the second of the season, March 11-19 and March 31-April 9.
