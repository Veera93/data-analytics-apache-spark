 RANCHO MIRAGE, Calif. — Pernilla Lindberg took advantage of her playing partner Sung Hyun Park’s late collapse to take a three-stroke lead on Saturday in the ANA Inspiration. Lindberg, a 31-year-old Swede, shot a two-under 70 on another hot and mostly calm day at Mission Hills, putting her in position to make the major championship her first professional victory. “I’ve played a lot of golf in my life, and I just feel like the pieces are kind of falling together,” Lindberg said. “I’m just letting it happen.” Amy Olson was second after a 68. A 25-year-old former North Dakota State star — and the L.P.G.A. Tour’s only certified public accountant — she is also seeking her first win as a pro. Lindberg was two strokes behind Park, the fourth-ranked South Korean player, after Park made her third straight birdie on the par-5 11th. The group was then put on the clock for slow play, and Park dropped five strokes in the next five holes. Park, the United States Women’s Open champion, bogeyed Nos. 12 and 13, had a double bogey on the par-4 14th after taking two shots to get out of the back bunker, and bogeyed the 16th. Lindberg scrambled for pars on the first four holes on the back nine, ran in an 18-foot birdie putt on 14 and made a 25-footer for par on 15 for a two-stroke swing. Lindberg bogeyed the par-3 17th and then hit a wedge to 5 feet to set up a birdie on the par-5 18th. She broke the tournament 54-hole mark at 14-under 202. “I felt calm out there. I had fun,” Lindberg said. “I went out there today and said, ‘How often do you get this chance? So I’m just going to enjoy it.’ And that’s what I did.” Park finished with a 74 to fall into a tie for third at 10 under. She shot a 64 on Friday for a share of the second-round lead with Lindberg. Inbee Park, the 2013 winner and a seven-time major champion, had a 67 to get into the group at 10 under with Moriya Jutanugarn (66), Jennifer Song (68), Jodi Ewart Shadoff (69) and Charley Hull (69). Inbee Park won the Founders Cup two weeks ago in Phoenix, playing the final 36 holes in 14 under. Lindberg rebounded from her first bogey of the week with a 20-foot par save on the par-4 sixth. A former Oklahoma State player, she made a 35-footer for birdie on the par-3 eighth. Olson, from Oxbow, N.D., had five birdies and a bogey. Ranked 218th in the world, she won an N.C.A.A.-record 20 titles for the Bison. Ayako Uehara (70) was nine under, and top-ranked Shanshan Feng (67) and Jessica Korda (73) were another stroke back. The Stanford sophomore Albane Valenzuela shot 71 to get to seven under and top the four amateurs to make the cut. Minjee Lee also was seven under after a 64, the best round of the day. Lexi Thompson was tied for 17th at six under after a 70. She won in 2015 and lost a playoff to So Yeon Ryu a year ago after being penalized four strokes during the final round for a rules violation the day before. Michelle Wie was two under after a 72. She has fought dizziness caused by a virus.
