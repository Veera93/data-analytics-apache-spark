 Chloe Kim, the 17-year-old American, is a big favorite in the women’s halfpipe snowboard com petition. She could well have been a contender four years ago as well, but at 13 she was too young to enter. Stay here for live results and analysis from the halfpipe in Pyeongchang: • Kim can land one of the most challenging tricks in the women’s halfpipe repertoire, the 1080: three complete rotations. And then she can land another, immediately afterward. • Kim threw down the gauntlet in qualifying, picking up the highest and second highest score of the competition on her two runs. Between them she tweeted that she was craving ice cream. • Three other Americans are also among the 12 finalists. • The snowboarders will take three runs, and only the best run will count.
