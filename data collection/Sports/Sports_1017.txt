 PRAGUE — In a move that could signify the end of his N.H.L. career, Jaromir Jagr has been reassigned by the Calgary Flames to the Kladno Knights, a team he owns in his native Czech Republic. The move on Monday came after Calgary placed Jagr, 45, on unconditional waivers for the purpose of terminating his N.H.L. contract so he could return to Europe to finish the season. Kladno, just west of Prague, is Jagr’s hometown. Jagr thanked Calgary “for giving me the immense opportunity to be a part of their team and continue my N.H.L. career,” adding, “I am very disappointed that things did not turn out as we had hoped.” Jagr had only a goal and six assists in 22 games for Calgary after signing a one-year, $1 million contract on Oct. 4. He has not played since Dec. 31 because of what the team called a lower-body injury. “I now look forward to continuing the season in Kladno,” he said. Jagr, who played his first N.H.L. game in 1990, is the league’s leader with 1,733 games played, 766 goals, 1,555 assists, and 1,921 points. He is second only to Wayne Gretzky on the career scoring list. “Jaromir Jagr is ready to return to the Czech Republic,” Kladno spokesman Vit Heral said.
