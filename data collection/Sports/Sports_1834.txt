 Dallas Cowboys running back Ezekiel Elliott’s last bid to stave off a six-game suspension was denied on Tuesday when a federal judge in New York declined to block his ban while he appealed the case. The decision, which blocked an emergency motion for an injunction for Elliott’s suspension, was made by Judge Katherine Polk Failla of the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York. Judge Failla had ruled on Monday that the N.F.L. had the right to suspend Elliott after accusations of domestic violence made by a former girlfriend in July 2016. Elliott was not arrested or charged by prosecutors, but the N.F.L. used statements by the woman, along with photos of the injuries he is accused of inflicting upon her, to justify the six-game suspension. Six games is the baseline punishment for a player who is involved in a domestic violence case for the first time. The players’ union on Tuesday also filed an appeal of the ban in the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, but that may take weeks or even months to process. Thus Elliott will begin serving the suspension starting Sunday, when Dallas is scheduled to host the Kansas City Chiefs.
