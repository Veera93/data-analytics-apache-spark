 MEMPHIS, Tenn. — The Memphis Grizzlies fired Coach David Fizdale on Monday, with the team at 7-12 after a run of eight straight losses, including a 98-88 defeat to the Nets on Monday in which Fizdale benched center Marc Gasol for the fourth quarter. General Manager Chris Wallace announced the move Monday. Assistant J.B. Bickerstaff was named interim head coach. “After a thorough evaluation, I decided a change in course was necessary to move forward and provide the team and organization its best chance at success this season and beyond,” Wallace said in a statement. The move caught many around the N.B.A. by surprise. Fizdale became the Grizzlies’ 13th head coach on May 29, 2016, and he went 50-51. The Grizzlies reached the postseason for a seventh straight year in Fizdale’s first season, when they lost to the San Antonio Spurs. Fizdale was fined $30,000 by the N.B.A. for a rant over officiating after a loss in Game 2 of that series. Memphis let Zach Randolph, Vince Carter and Tony Allen leave as free agents and signed Ben McLemore, Tyreke Evans and Mario Chalmers to retool the roster around Gasol and point guard Mike Conley to give Fizdale a faster lineup. The moves appeared to be working when Memphis started this season at 5-1, which led the N.B.A. The Grizzlies stood atop the Western Conference with a win over the Golden State Warriors and two over the Houston Rockets, their Southwest Division rivals. But Conley has been out since Nov. 17 resting an aching left Achilles’ tendon. The eight-game losing streak was the franchise’s longest since Feb. 11-March 3, 2009. Fizdale kept Gasol on the bench for the fourth quarter, and the center made his unhappiness clear after the game. “It’s a first for me, trust me, and I don’t like it one bit,” said Gasol, who leads Memphis in points, rebounds and assists. The Grizzlies gave Gasol a maximum deal in July 2015, and Gasol was an All-Star in Fizdale’s inaugural season.
