 Miami moved up to No. 2, behind Alabama, in the College Football Playoff rankings on Tuesday, with Clemson slipping one spot to third and Oklahoma holding at No. 4. Wisconsin and Auburn remained next up behind the top four in a week when the top half of the selection committee’s rankings were mostly unchanged. Georgia, Notre Dame, Ohio State, Penn State and Southern California followed in the same order as they did last week. Over the next two weeks, every team in the top nine will play another team ranked in the committee’s top 25, including four games matching top playoff contenders. The Crimson Tide will play at Auburn on Saturday to determine a spot in the Southeastern Conference championship on Dec. 2. The winner plays Georgia. The Atlantic Coast Conference championship will match Clemson and Miami on Dec. 2, and Wisconsin and Ohio State will play in the Big Ten championship.
