 CLEVELAND — After the Cavaliers’ fourth loss in five games, LeBron James is turning to the calendar for comfort. “What month is this for me? October? I’m not about to go crazy over it right now. It’s too long of a season. I’ve been a part of this way too many times,” James said after Sunday night’s startling 114-95 loss at home to the Knicks. Tim Hardaway Jr. scored 34 points and Kristaps Porzingis had 32 and the Knicks won for the second time after losing their first three games. The Cavaliers, who were routed, 123-101, in New Orleans on Saturday are now below .500 with a 3-4 record. “Tonight’s loss and the last couple are unacceptable,” said the Cavaliers’ coach, Tyronn Lue. The Cavaliers are favorites to return to the N.B.A. finals for the fourth straight season, but they need, in particular, to do something about their defense. “Guys are scoring at will against us,” James said. “Our defense is pretty bad right now.” The Knicks, after winning their first game Friday over the Nets, led, 89-71, late in the third quarter. Cleveland cut the margin to six points on James’s drive in the fourth quarter, forcing the Knicks to call a timeout with 8:21 left and a 94-88 lead. Courtney Lee then scored on a drive and hit a 3-pointer, helping the Knicks make it 103-88. The Knicks took their largest lead, 114-93, in the final minute. “We could have folded against a veteran team like that, but we made some big shots and pulled it out,” said Knicks Coach Jeff Hornacek. The Knicks beat Cleveland for the first time since Oct. 30, 2014 — which was James’ first game back with the Cavaliers after playing four seasons in Miami. “It’s nice to finally beat the Cavs for the first time in my career,” Porzingis said. Hardaway came in shooting 27 percent in his first four games this season but scored 24 points in the first half. For the game, he was 11 of 19 from the field and hit 5 of 10 3-pointers. “I did a lot more attacking,” Hardaway said. “I took the 3’s when they were there. Seeing one go down opens up a lot.” Kevin Love led the Cavaliers with 22 points while James had 16. Derrick Rose returned after missing four games for Cleveland because of a sprained left ankle and scored 15 points. Cleveland led, 13-10, but Hardaway scored 10 points, including two 3-pointers and a dunk off an alley-oop pass from Jarrett Jack, as the Knicks went on a 14-0 run. The Cavaliers tied it at 49 late in the second quarter, but the Knicks scored 7 straight points and pushed the lead to 62-54 at halftime.
