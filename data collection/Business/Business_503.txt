 Q. How do you do picture-in-picture video with Safari on a Mac?  A. In macOS Sierra and later, you can use the Picture in Picture mode to pop out a floating video-player window on the screen while you have other pages and programs open on the desktop. The feature works in the Safari browser for videos on sites that use the HTML 5 standard for playback, like Vimeo and YouTube. Videos from Apple’s iTunes Store support the Picture in Picture view, as do some other apps. To use the Picture in Picture mode, open a compatible video and, in the tool bar of playback controls, click the icon on the right that looks like two rectangles. The video should pop out in a small, separate window that you can resize by dragging its corner with the cursor. To reposition the video window, drag it to your preferred side of the screen. If you do not want to anchor the window in a screen corner, hold down the Mac’s Command key while you drag the window to your preferred position on the desktop. When you hover the cursor over the video window, you get controls to pause or play the clip, or to exit the Picture in Picture mode. (You can also click the X in the upper-left corner of the video window to close it.) To fast-forward or rewind through the clip, however, you need to use the playback controls on the video’s page in the main Safari window. Some videos may not display the Picture in Picture icon on the playback tool bar. In this case, hold down the Mac’s Control key and double-click the video window. When the shortcut menu appears, look for an “Enter Picture in Picture” option. Some videos may not have even that, but for those video apps that do not work with the Mac’s Picture in Picture mode, a Safari extension called PiPifier might coax the clips into their separate windows.
