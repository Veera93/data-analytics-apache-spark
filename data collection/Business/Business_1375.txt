 Q. I have a few programs in my Windows 7 Startup folder, but my PC is slow. I think there’s a lot more happening when the computer boots up. Is there one place to look to see everything that’s running instead of poking around in a bunch of different windows? A. If you want a detailed overview of all the programs, services, drivers, tool bars and other bits of code that start up along with Windows, Microsoft has a free utility for you. The program is called Autoruns. It has been around for several years and works on several recent versions of Windows. A page on Microsoft’s site calls it “the most comprehensive knowledge of auto-starting locations of any start-up monitor.” Microsoft’s site has a link to download Autoruns and brief instructions for using it after you install it. With Autoruns, you can see and manage everything that starts up with Windows. Click any of the various tabs at the top of the window, like Scheduled Tasks, Office or Internet Explorer, to see what is running in those categories. Right-click on an entry to get more information and a menu of actions. For the less technically inclined, Autoruns may seem like a bewildering eyeful, but the Microsoft Press site has a longer, illustrated guide to the software. Windows-themed sites like the Windows Club or the How-To Geek also have helpful tips for using the utility. In addition to several programs in the Startup folder, PCs can take their time booting up as antivirus programs run their scans or online file-sharing services update their files, or if the hard drive is overstuffed and in need of defragmentation. Microsoft’s support site has its own page of suggestions and an automated Fixit tool designed to help improve system performance.
