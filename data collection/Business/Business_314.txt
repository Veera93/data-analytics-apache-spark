 Q. Is it possible to read Nook books on a Kindle? Is there an e-reader that handles books from multiple e-bookstores? A. The Barnes &amp; Noble Nook e-books and Amazon’s Kindle e-books use different formats, but dedicated users have shown it is possible to convert and read Nook books on an Amazon device. How you do it depends on the hardware you have — and can take some technical fiddling to copy over Nook books to a Kindle e-reader or Fire tablet. Slinging e-books between two brands of e-readers is generally unsupported by all companies. It can also involve breaking the built-in copyright protections — so read all the fine print to fully understand what is allowed. One approach is sideloading the Barnes &amp; Noble Nook app (or even the Google Play store) for Android onto an Amazon Kindle Fire tablet, which allows you to download and read your Nook books within their own app. You can find various book-moving tutorials for e-readers and Fire tablets online with a quick search. If you do not want to put a lot of effort into corralling all your digital books on one tablet, you can go another route. If you have an Android, iOS or Windows 10 tablet at your disposal, you can install the Nook, Kindle, Kobo and other e-book mobile apps there to unify your collection on one device. If you are looking to replace an old Nook e-reader with something more versatile, an inexpensive Android-based tablet stocked with e-book apps can serve as an all-purpose portable library for all your e-books.
