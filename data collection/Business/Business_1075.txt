 Q. How do you delete Kindle books you have finished on an iPad? A. When you have completed an e-book and are ready to remove it from your iPad, open the iOS Kindle app and go to your library screen that displays your collection. Tap the Downloaded button at the top of the screen to see only the books stored on the tablet. When you find the book you want to delete, swipe to the left and tap the red Archive button. For more options, you can instead press your finger on the cover image for a second until a menu appears. Choose Remove From Device to delete the book from the iPad. (You can dump old sample chapters and other free content from the Kindle app by selecting the Delete Permanently option from the menu instead.) Amazon keeps a record of all your content purchases in your online account with the company, which allows you to download and sync the same book across multiple devices running Kindle apps. Removing a book from the iPad does not delete it from your library of purchased books from Amazon’s cloud servers, and you can download it to the iPad again if you ever want to reread it. To do that, tap the All button on your Kindle library screen to see all your purchases (not just the downloaded items). Tap the book cover to download it again. If you want to permanently delete a book from your Kindle collection stored in the Amazon cloud, log into your account on the company’s site and go to the Manage Your Content and Devices page. You can get to it by clicking the triangle next to Your Account &amp; Lists on the left side of the Amazon page and selecting Your Content and Devices. Next, click the Your Content tab. In the list, find the book you want to remove for good and click the Actions button next to the title. In the pop-up menu, click Delete. You should see a warning box asking you to confirm your decision, as deleting the book here permanently erases it from your cloud library and you will have to buy it again if you want to read it again.
