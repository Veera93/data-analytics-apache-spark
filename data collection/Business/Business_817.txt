 A European court has sided with the German sporting goods maker Adidas on Thursday in its long-running attempt to block two trademarks for parallel stripes on shoes filed by a Belgian footwear company, saying they infringed on its own iconic three-stripe design. The decision by the Luxembourg-based General Court, Europe’s second-highest, affirmed earlier rulings by the European Union Intellectual Property Office, or E.U.I.P.O. The decision on Thursday allows Adidas to oppose the trademark registration of the two parallel stripes by the footwear company Shoe Branding Europe. The court said in a news release that the Belgian company had not demonstrated due cause for its use and that the stripes applied for risked “taking unfair advantage of Adidas’ earlier mark.” The Belgian company filed the application in 2009 and 2011 with the E.U.I.P.O. for registration of the two trademarks: one for footwear and the other for safety footwear. Adidas opposed the filing on the grounds that the two-stripe mark was confusingly similar to its existing three-stripe registrations and would take unfair advantage of, or be detrimental to, the repute of such marks. In 2015 and 2016, the E.U.I.P.O. refused Shoe Branding Europe’s registration in separate decisions. On Wednesday, Adidas’ chief executive, Kasper Rorsted, said sales rose between 15 percent and 20 percent to more than 20 billion euros in 2017, helped by growth in China, North America and e-commerce. An Adidas spokeswoman said there was no change to the company’s forecast for sales to rise at a currency-adjusted 17percent-19 percent in 2017. It reports annual results on March 14. Adidas shares were up 1.6 percent at 10:15 GMT, the biggest increase on the German blue-chip index.
