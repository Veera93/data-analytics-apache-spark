 The shiny new cars get all the attention. But behind the scenes at the Detroit auto show — officially called the North American International Auto Show — a small army prepares the city’s Cobo Center for the invasion of vehicles and their fans. From the front door to the velvet rope, workers are responsible for setting the stage and dressing the models. Sometimes, that means a fresh coat of mud. Quilted fabric protects fragile items and pristine paint jobs from damage as workers began the task of turning piles of parts into welcoming displays. Once the cars come out from under wraps, they must be primped for the occasion. An artist applied fake mud to a Mercedes-Benz sport utility vehicle to enhance its rugged vibe. Visual appeal is a must, whether a visitor is in Lexus’s lounge area or buying a hooded sweatshirt from the Ram booth. Mercedes-Benz may have dirtied up a G-Class to illustrate its off-road prowess, but it still insisted on a clean floor. The sports cars were not the only thing worthy of being polished by hand. Many hands may make for light work, but the auto industry’s heavy hitters demand that their displays are just so. And once everything was in place, Detroit was ready to unveil the fruit of its labor.
