 It wasn’t too hot. It wasn’t too cold. Investors welcomed Friday’s unemployment and jobs data from the government, which showed a near-perfect combination of surprisingly strong job growth and little indication of rising wages that could prompt the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates faster. The Standard &amp; Poor’s 500-stock, the Dow Jones industrial average and the Nasdaq composite index all closed more than 1.7 percent higher, driven by gains across a range of sectors. “The February jobs report seems supportive of the goldilocks economic story of continued strong employment gains amidst moderate inflation pressures,” economists from BNP Paribas wrote in a client note Friday. The economy produced 313,000 new jobs in February. After the report, investors moved out of super-safe United States government bonds, pushing prices down and yields — which move in the opposite direction — slightly higher. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note, an important benchmark, topped 2.90 percent. The market reaction on Friday was in sharp contrast to what happened after last month’s employment report. Then, a faster-than-expected rise in wages worried investors that inflation was coming. Stock markets plunged, as investors feared that the Fed would raise interest rates to fend off inflation.
