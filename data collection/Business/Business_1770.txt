 Good Thursday. Here’s what we’re watching: • The F.C.C. formally voted to overturn Obama-era net neutrality regulations. • How does the Disney deal affect Fox’s efforts to buy control of Sky? • The media world is gossiping over whether someone might try to top Disney. • Meet the advisers who helped put the transaction together. • Tim Cook and Charles Koch wrote a joint op-ed urging protection of Dreamers. Want this in your inbox every morning? Here’s the sign-up. As the Trump administration moves to block one media deal, it appears more supportive of today’s big transaction. From Shannon Pettypiece of Bloomberg: But then there’s the jobs angle  Ms. Sanders also inserted the White House into the little matter of mergers and layoffs. She said that Mr. Trump thinks that today’s deal could be “a great thing” for jobs. There’s a problem. Here’s what Disney’s C.F.O., Christine McCarthy, told analysts this morning: As Andrew reminded earlier this week, “synergies” is a code word for “layoffs.” And Disney executives said that the company expects to start realizing synergies within the first year after the deal closes. It isn’t clear yet how many jobs would be cut if the transaction succeeds, but this would be a rare deal if it actually generated new positions on balance. — Michael J. de la Merced Fox has a bit of unfinished business before it can go forward with its deal with Disney. It’s in the process of seeking regulatory approval in Britain to take full control of the British satellite television giant Sky in a deal worth about $15 billion. The two companies said on Thursday that Fox plans to proceed with the acquisition and hopes to complete the acquisition of the 61 percent of Sky that it doesn’t own by the end of June. Sky would then be wholly owned by Disney, following the closing of the Fox deal. The context: Mr. Murdoch helped found Sky in the early 1990s and has long sought total ownership of it. He last tried to do so five years ago, but was forced to back off amid the controversy over phone hacking by British tabloids, including the since-shuttered Murdoch-owned News of the World. Mr. Murdoch’s company had previously said that its existing stake in Sky was “not a natural end position.” The complications: British regulators have been concerned about how much control the Murdoch family would exert over the country’s media and whether Fox, as an entity, would uphold broadcasting standards here. In June, the regulator Ofcom ruled that Rupert Murdoch and other company executives were “fit and proper” to hold broadcasting licenses in Britain, even as it also concluded that a sexual harassment scandal at Fox News had amounted to “significant corporate failures.” Britain’s culture minister, Karen Bradly, asked the country’s competition regulator in September to carry out an in-depth review of the Sky transaction. That review is ongoing and provisional findings by the Competition and Markets Authority are expected to be released in January. The official word: “While 21st Century Fox’s existing plans to acquire Sky remain in place, we expect the current investigation to continue,” a spokesman for the Department for Digital, Culture, Media &amp; Sport said on Thursday. The question: Some analysts have speculated that the British government might be more comfortable with a Sky deal if Disney is the ultimate owner, but whether the Sky deal ultimately received approval remains an open question for now. — Chad Bray As part of his company’s $52.4 billion deal for Fox, Bob Iger of Disney agreed to renew his contract through 2021 to help complete the merger and integrate the new businesses. That would seem to mean a 2020 presidential run is off the table for Mr. Iger. In March, The Hollywood Reporter reported that Mr. Iger “had told friends he is considering their nudges that he make a run for president in 2020 as a Democrat. “ The publication added: Here are a few other notable business people that are on the list: • Howard Schultz of Starbucks • Mark Cuban • Oprah Winfrey • Mark Zuckerberg of Facebook — Stephen Grocer That’s the question that media executives and Wall Street bankers have been asking this morning. Could a digital company like Amazon, Google or Apple emerge with a higher bid? Or Verizon or Comcast? Or could some of them team up to buy the assets and split them among themselves? For example, Comcast has always wanted Fox’s international assets, while any of the digital players would love to own Fox’s content business. The Fox-Disney deal has about a $1.5 billion breakup fee if a higher bid were to emerge. If regulators block the deal, Disney would have to pay about $2.5 billion. The Murdochs’ voting control is worth 39 percent of 21st Century Fox in most situations, except for this: If the company were up for sale, they can only vote their economic stake, which is about 17 percent. And of course, even if the deal is completed as presented today, the next chess piece that will become a point of focus is Hulu given its ownership: Disney would control 60 percent of the service, but Comcast would still own 30 percent and Time Warner owns another 10 percent. It gets complicated quickly. — Andrew Ross Sorkin Ryan Parker of The Hollywood Reporter tweeted that one of “The Simpsons” showrunners, Al Jean, told him, “I predict people will make far too much of this mere coincidence.” Matt Selman, an executive producer of “The Simpsons,” tweeted this: And, more important, how some of them will split an estimated fee bounty of up to $154 million. For Disney: • Guggenheim Partners • JPMorgan Chase • Cravath Swaine &amp; Moore For Fox: • Goldman Sachs • Centerview Partners • Deutsche Bank • Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher &amp; Flom • Hogan Lovells • Simpson Thacher &amp; Bartlett Here’s how much each set of advisers could collect According to estimates from Freeman &amp; Company: • Disney’s bankers could split between $62 million and $71 million. • Fox’s bankers could share between $73 million and $83 million. — Michael J. de la Merced Here’s Paul Pendergrass’s take: One is a tech C.E.O. who has publicly espoused socially liberal initiatives. The other is one of the most prolific and prominent conservative donors around. But Mr. Cook and Mr. Koch have written an op-ed in the WaPo imploring Congress to give “dreamers” — the young immigrants at the center of a fight over illegal immigration — a path to staying in the U.S. From the piece: — Michael J. de la Merced Let’s break down the Disney deal with Fox that was just announced: • Disney will pay about $29.45 a share in an all-stock transaction, buying a big chunk of Fox businesses valued at about $66 billion, including debt. • Fox shareholders as a whole will own about 25 percent of The Walt Disney Company. • As expected, today’s announcement has no mention of a role for James Murdoch at Disney. That may come down the line as he negotiates with Disney. • The Murdochs, who own about 17 percent of existing shares in Fox, will own less than 5 percent of Disney and won’t have any board seats there. What Robert Iger of Disney has to say  What’s at stake: Disney wants to bolster its defenses against Netflix and Amazon. The deal will give the media giant another production studio to pump out content for its forthcoming video streaming service. And Fox’s international broadcasting operations will extend its reach abroad. A deeper dive: Ben Thompson of Stratechery takes a look at how effective a response this is to Netflix. He writes, “What has been so impressive over the last few months is the extent and speed with which Disney has seemingly figured it out — and acted accordingly.” It includes: • The corporate tax rate going down to 21 percent,instead of 20 percent • The top tax rate going down to 37 percent • A $10,000 deduction that can be split between mortgage payments and state and local taxes • A repeal of the corporate alternative minimum tax, but not the individual A.M.T. • The repeal of the individual insurance mandate • A preservation of tax breaks for medical expenses and tuition stipends for graduate students • A tax deduction for pass-through businesses that largely mirrors the Senate bill’s treatment The cost: still unclear. From President Trump: “We’re very close to getting it done; we’re very close to voting.” The Senate holdouts: So far, Bob Corker of Tennessee looks likely to again reject the bill on budget deficit grounds. It’s unclear whether Susan Collins of Maine or Marco Rubio are on board after having raised concerns, though neither has raised fresh objections in recent days. The tax flyaround • Although Mr. Trump has talked of the tax code drawing companies back to the United States from Ireland, the overhaul may make little difference with investment in the European Union country. (WaPo) • Even as Jamie Dimon extols the benefits of the G.O.P. tax plan, banks could face higher taxes on important transactions like repo agreements. (Axios, WSJ) • Jeff Gundlach of DoubleLine Capital warned that the tax overhaul could pose problems for the $1.5 trillion market for junk bonds. (MarketWatch) You can watch the meeting here. This is perhaps the biggest victory yet for the F.C.C. chairman, Ajit Pai, who has already opened the door for more media mergers, curtailed a high-speed internet program for low-income families and allowed broadband providers to raise rates to business customers. A useful explanation of the net neutrality changes:  Geoff Fowler of the WaPo illustrates the issue using airport security lines. The Fed has concluded that Republican tax plan isn’t economic “rocket fuel,” though it will modestly improve economic growth. The regulator predicts 2.5 percent growth next year, up from 2.1 percent — but not enough to change the Fed’s plan for three rate increases next year. When told that the president thinks the Republican tax plan could lead to growth of more than 4 percent, here’s what Ms. Yellen said: Ms. Yellen’s parting comment: “Let me emphasize that correlation is not causation.” Looking abroad: Mario Draghi’s final European Central Bank news conference of 2017 is today. Here’s what to expect. Any final deal on Britain’s withdrawal from the European Union will have to be submitted to Parliament as legislation before it can be put into effect. It was a defeat for the prime minister, who wanted more leeway to negotiate with the European Union. Ms. May is scheduled to be in Brussels for an E.U. Council meeting, where the Europeans are expected to allow Brexit negotiations to proceed to discussions about trade, amid renewed questions about her authority. On top of that, she is under pressure to explain what exactly Britain wants from an E.U. trade relationship, even though she has yet to find a consensus within her own cabinet.
