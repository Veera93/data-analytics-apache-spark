 Q. When is the Twitter desktop app for Mac going away, and what are the alternatives if I don’t want to keep the web version open on a browser all day? A. Twitter announced on Feb. 16 that it had just retired its official Mac desktop software from the Mac App Store and planned to support the existing program for only 30 more days. So expect the Mac Twitter app to lose altitude by mid-March. While Twitter suggests using its website for the full “experience on a Mac,” the Mac App Store offers some third-party alternatives if you prefer to stick with a more customizable program. (As it was, Twitter’s stand-alone app for the Mac had not been updated for quite a while, leaving some users frustrated with it.) Tweetbot for Mac ($9.99) and Twitterific 5 for Twitter ($7.99) are the two major replacement options for Twitter’s own Mac app. Both include more features — like the new 280-character limit — than Twitter’s abandoned program. Either program works with multiple Twitter accounts, and if you use the corresponding mobile app, you can keep your feed in sync across devices. Read the features list and reviews for each one if you have not decided which one you want. Twitter’s free TweetDeck dashboard for tracking real-time conversations is still available in the Mac App Store. Additionally, TweetDeck can be used through Twitter’s website.
