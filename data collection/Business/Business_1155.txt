 Q. On Android, how do I add caption information to individual pictures I have stored online in a Google Photos album? The text edit tool in the Google Photos Help guide seems to just add a caption on the whole album. A. You can add a personal caption to individual images in the Google Photos album by tapping the thumbnail of each picture to open it to the full-screen view. When the picture expands, tap the Info button at the bottom; the icon looks like an “i” in a small circle. When you are on the picture’s Info screen, you should see an “Add a description” line at the top. Tap it to type in your caption information. Tap the Back button when you’re done. You — and others looking at the album online — can see the caption by going to the Info screen, but the information is not embedded in the image file and does not travel along if you share a copy of the picture by email. But you will not see the “Add a description” field on photos that are stored locally on your Android device and have not been uploaded to a Google Photos album. A photo’s Info screen also displays other details about the file, like the time and place it was taken, where it is stored locally and the exposure, lens and camera type used to take it. If you have the location services feature enabled on your device, you’ll see the geographic coordinates and a map showing where the picture was taken. You can add descriptions to pictures in an online album the same way using a web browser — just select an image and hit the Info button. The captions you add will appear in small type at the bottom of the photo as you click through a desktop slide show.
