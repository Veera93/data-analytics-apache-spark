 PARIS — Already facing scrutiny from antitrust authorities and privacy regulators on a variety of fronts, Google was criticized Wednesday by French data protection authorities, who accused the company of being insufficiently forthcoming in an investigation of its new privacy policy. On behalf of the 27 member states of the European Union, the French data protection agency, the National Commission for Computing and Liberties, known as C.N.I.L., is investigating a privacy policy that Google instituted across the range of its online services this year. In February, it asked Google to delay adoption of the new policy, saying it had “deep concerns” about whether it complied with European law. Google instituted the new system anyway. After a meeting with Google executives on Wednesday, the commission said the company’s answers to a questionnaire about the new policy had not addressed some of its concerns, including the sharing of data across different Google services. “The C.N.I.L. reiterates its concerns about the purposes and the breadth of these combinations as well as their legal basis,” the agency said in a statement. “The C.N.I.L. welcomes Google’s collaboration but regrets that the answers are often incomplete or approximate,” it added. The panel said it had sent a new questionnaire to Google, giving it a deadline of June 8. After that, the agency will send its recommendations to the European Commission’s data protection panel, which is scheduled to report back to Google by mid-July. Google said in a statement: “We have received the C.N.I.L.’s follow-up questions, and we are reviewing them. We are confident that our privacy notices respect the requirements of European data protection laws.” When Google announced the new policy, it billed it as a way to streamline and simplify the privacy practices it employs worldwide across about 60 different online services.
