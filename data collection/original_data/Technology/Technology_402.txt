 Dell, the personal computer maker, forecast second-quarter revenue on Tuesday that fell short of analysts’ estimates as businesses held off on buying personal computers and smartphones and tablets ate into the company’s sales. The company also reported fiscal first-quarter earnings and revenue that missed Wall Street’s expectations. Dell said its revenue for its fiscal second quarter ending in July would total $14.7 billion to $15 billion. Analysts had been projecting revenue of $15.4 billion according to a survey by Bloomberg News. “In my own interactions with larger customers, we are seeing a delay and a pause in spending activity,” Michael S. Dell, the company’s chief executive, said in a conference call with analysts and investors. Dell has also been hurt by demand for Apple’s iPhone and iPad and other mobile devices that are replacing notebook computers, executives said. Dell plans to sell tablets running Microsoft’s Windows 8 operating system when it is released this fall, Mr. Dell said. Dell reported fiscal first-quarter net income of $635 million, or 36 cents a share, compared with $945 million, or 49 cents, a year earlier. Its revenue fell 4 percent, to $14.4 billion, below analysts’ average estimate of $14.9 billion. The company’s profit excluding some one-time items in the quarter was 43 cents a share, less than the 46 cents a share that Wall Street had been expecting. Dell has minimized its sales of less profitable PCs in an effort to increase its profit margin, which is causing revenue to slump, said Shaw Wu, an analyst at Sterne Agee &amp; Leach.
