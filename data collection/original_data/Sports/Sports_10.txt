 Looking for the most exciting things to do in the most exciting city in the world? Sign up for our new limited-edition newsletter, Summer in the City, to get fresh ideas delivered to your inbox weekly. In each newsletter, we’ll send you two itineraries spotlighting the best adventures New York City has to offer that week. (Added bonus: We’ll review beforehand.) One itinerary will provide the most fun idea for a date night or an outing with friends. The other itinerary will offer great activities for entertaining kids and out-of-town guests like Mom and Dad. And we won’t forget to review the best places nearby for food and drink. Don’t worry about a big commitment — like summer, this newsletter will be fleeting. Summer in the City kicks off this May and runs only through Labor Day. Sign up for the newsletter here, and your first summer plans will land in your inbox the week before Memorial Day.
