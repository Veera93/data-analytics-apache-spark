 One by one, the hopes crash and the snow flies. An athlete falls. The poetry of their movements, calibrated over many years to propel them toward glory, is interrupted in an instant. It twists into something uncoordinated and unrehearsed. Winning form becomes survival mode. Hopes turn to prayers. The Winter Olympics do wipeouts like no other sporting event. The combination of snow and ice, speed and air makes for something spectacular and frightening. Bodies slide, somersault and cartwheel. Gear pops off. Plumes of snow rise and settle, the fog of a broken dream. Most of the time, fortunately, nobody gets seriously hurt. Maybe there is another chance. Maybe there is notoriety. For now, there is just a moment, unscripted and unwanted. Everybody watching, but for all the wrong reasons. They do make for incredible photographs, donâ€™t they?
