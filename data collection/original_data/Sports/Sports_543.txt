 Kansas City Royals outfielder Jorge Bonifacio has been suspended 80 games by Major League Baseball after testing positive for a performance-enhancing substance. The commissionerâ€™s office made the announcement on Saturday. Bonifacio was barred after a positive test for Boldenone. The penalty will begin on opening day. Bonifacio, 24, made his major league debut last season, hitting .255 with 17 home runs and 40 runs batted in in 113 games. Kansas City was reshuffling its outfield this spring after Lorenzo Cain left as a free agent, and Bonifacio was competing for playing time in the field and at designated hitter. The Royals recently signed the free-agent outfielder Jon Jay. Paulo Orlando and several others are also trying to earn spots in the outfield. Bonifacio is the fourth player suspended this year under the major league drug program. Houston pitcher Dean Deetz, Washington catcher Raudy Read and Pittsburgh pitcher Nik Turley were previously penalized.
