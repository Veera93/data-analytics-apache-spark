 EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. — The Giants have fired Marc Ross, the team’s vice president for player evaluation for the last five seasons. The team’s new general manager, Dave Gettleman, on Saturday announced the move, his first since rejoining the franchise. Ross had been with the Giants since 2007, serving six years as director of college scouting. Ross had been in charge of the Giants’ draft, along with the previous general manager, Jerry Reese, who was let go this month. Ross was one of four candidates to interview for the general manager position. Among the players New York drafted under Ross were Odell Beckham Jr., Sterling Shepard, Landon Collins and Jason Pierre-Paul.
