 INDIANAPOLIS — Thaddeus Young scored 20 points to lead seven Indiana players in double figures as the Pacers routed the short-handed Knicks, 115-97, on Monday night. Bojan Bogdanovic scored 19 points and Victor Oladipo added 16 for the Pacers (13-11), who led by 26 at halftime and by 95-65 after three quarters. The Knicks (11-12) were without their leading scorers, Kristaps Porzingis (25.8 points per game) and Tim Hardaway Jr. (17.8), for a second consecutive loss. Porzingis is dealing with a sprained right ankle and illness, and Hardaway has a lower left leg injury. Michael Beasley led the Knicks with 13 points. The Pacers, who entered the game with the second-best 3-point percentage in the N.B.A. (.397), hit 11 of 26 3-pointers. Pacers center Myles Turner blocked a shot in the first quarter to extend his streak of at least one block in every game this season. Turner, a third-year pro whose 39 blocks rank second in the league, has had as many as three blocks in nine games. Although the Knicks fell behind early, recent history suggested that didn’t foreclose the possibility of a comeback. They have rallied from double-digit deficits to win six games this season, including being down 19 at home in the third quarter of a 108-101 victory over the Pacers on Nov. 5. A 108-100 home win over Toronto on Nov. 22 turned on a 28-0 run in the third quarter, the longest run by the team since 1991-92. The Knicks’ overall record at Bankers Life Fieldhouse dropped to 8-27. The Pacers, who are 7-4 at home, started a stretch of six consecutive home games, which will run through Dec. 15. They are 6-0 when scoring 120 points and 0-4 when scoring less than 100.
