 When does Iceland come before Estonia? In the Korean alphabet, for one. And, this year at least, in the opening ceremony of the Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang, South Korea. The backbone of the opening ceremony at any Games is the parade of nations, the seemingly endless processional of every delegation into the stadium before the torch is lit. While there are always a diversity of outfits and glimpses of athletic stars, its sheer length can test even the most geographically fascinated fan. Friday night’s parade was scheduled to run for nearly an hour, but as usual it was safer to bet the over. As it did four years ago in Sochi, Russia, this year’s parade of nations may cause some confusion for television viewers. That is because the teams always enter the stadium alphabetically — according to the alphabet of the host country. Four years ago, that meant the order of nations made sense to Russians and others who use a Cyrillic alphabet, but not to everyone. This year, unless you’re fluent in Korean, the parade will offer a dash of the unexpected. Norway and the Netherlands were near the front on Friday, but after South Africa and before Latvia and Lebanon. Denmark and Germany, which share a land border but a gap in the Latin alphabet, came in one after the other. And the team from the United States entered right on the heels of Malta and Mongolia, and just ahead of Bermuda and Belgium. (Yes, Malta, Mongolia and Bermuda have Winter Olympic teams.) Regardless of your preferred alphabet, though, there is always one bit of continuity that fans can rely on: Greece, the host of the ancient Olympics and the first modern one, enters first, and the host nation — this year, a unified Korean team — marches in last.
