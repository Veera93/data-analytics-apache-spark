 How do you top winning the World Series? Carlos Correa did it by proposing. Interviewed after the game on Fox, Correa, the Astros’ shortstop, said of their World Series title, “It’s one of the biggest accomplishments of my life, and right now I want to take another big step in my life.” Producing a ring from his back pocket, Correa turned to his girlfriend and said, “Daniella Rodriguez, will you make me the happiest man in the world? Will you marry me?” Rodriguez answered affirmatively. Rodriguez was Miss Texas USA in 2016 and got to throw out the first ball at an Astros game in August. Her effort was not especially memorable. It was probably the most high-profile post-sports event proposal since at least 2007, when Ian Johnson of Boise State’s football team proposed to his girlfriend, Chrissy Popadics, after the Broncos’ wild Fiesta Bowl win over Oklahoma. Earlier on Wednesday, Correa showed no sign of pre-proposal nerves, as he playfully tossed a cup of water in the face of the actor Ken Jeong, who was waving a giant Dodgers flag atop the Astros dugout. Correa was 1 for 4 on the night.
