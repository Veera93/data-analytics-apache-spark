 Kristaps Porzingis scored 28 points, including a tie-breaking 3-pointer with 1 minute 48 seconds remaining, and the Knicks beat the Charlotte Hornets, 118-113, on Tuesday night for their third straight victory. Porzingis, the Eastern Conference’s player of the week, was held below 30 for only the third time in 10 games this season, but he delivered when it mattered, scoring 7 points in the final 1:32. Doug McDermott added a season-high 20 points off the bench and Tim Hardaway Jr. had 19 for the Knicks, who have won six of seven after an 0-3 start. The Knicks shot 60 percent from the field to catch up and eventually pass Charlotte. Kemba Walker, Dwight Howard and the rookie Malik Monk each had 21 points in the Hornets’ third straight loss. The Knicks, who erased a 19-point deficit against Indiana in their last game, were down 15 in this one before mounting a charge in the fourth quarter with Porzingis on the bench. They cut it to 4 with about 7 minutes left, but Howard converted a follow shot and Walker banked in a 3-pointer to push the lead back to 109-100 with 5:34 to play. The Knicks answered with four 3-pointers in a 14-2 run, with Porzingis’ clutch shot from straightaway making it 114-111. His drive to the basket with 11 seconds remaining made it 116-113, and Monk missed a 3-pointer before Walker lost the ball out of bounds on the sideline. The Hornets were 7 of 9 from 3-point range in the first quarter and led 41-32. They increased the lead to 69-58 at halftime even with the Knicks hitting 61 percent of their shots in the first 24 minutes.
