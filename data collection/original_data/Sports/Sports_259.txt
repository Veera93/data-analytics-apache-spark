 Timberwolves guard Jimmy Butler is planning to return to Minnesota’s lineup Friday night against the Los Angeles Lakers to begin his comeback from February knee surgery, according to two people familiar with Butler’s decision. After missing 17 games, Butler hopes to play in Minnesota’s final three regular-season games to help the club secure its first playoff berth in 14 seasons, according to the people, who were not authorized to discuss Butler’s plans publicly. Butler is expected to go through one final test in Friday night’s pregame warm-ups in Los Angeles but has targeted this game for his full-fledged return after watching Thursday night’s loss at Denver from the bench in uniform. The Timberwolves have gone 8-9 without Butler since he had surgery on his left knee Feb. 25 after sustaining a meniscus injury two days earlier. Saddled with the league’s longest active playoff drought, dating to the 2003-4 season, Minnesota has slipped from third to eighth in the Western Conference during Butler’s absence. Butler, 28, is averaging 22.2 points, 5.0 assists, 5.4 rebounds and 1.9 steals in his first season in Minnesota. He told local reporters on Tuesday that he was “this close” to returning from the injury.
