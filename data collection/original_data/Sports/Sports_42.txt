 TAMPA, Fla. — Rick Nash and the Boston Bruins’ high-scoring line of Patrice Bergeron, David Pastrnak and Brad Marchand are off to a flying start in the second round of the Stanley Cup playoffs. Nash had two goals and Bergeron, Pastrnak and Marchand combined for 10 points on Saturday, helping the Bruins pull away for a 6-2 victory over the Tampa Bay Lightning in Game 1 of the best-of-seven series. Bergeron also scored twice, Marchand had a goal and two assists, and Pastrnak finished with four assists in a dominating performance. Tuukka Rask stopped 34 shots for the Bruins, who finished one point behind Tampa Bay for the Atlantic Division title, as well as the No. 1 seed in the Eastern Conference. Dan Girardi and Mikhail Sergachev scored for the Lightning, who trailed, 3-2, entering the third period. Marchand and Bergeron hiked Boston’s advantage to three goals before Jake DeBrusk added an empty-netter with 6 minutes 19 seconds remaining. The Bruins had just 10 shots against Lightning goalie Andrei Vasilevskiy over the last two periods, but made the most of the limited opportunities. Game 2 is Monday night at Amalie Arena. Rask won three of four starts against the Lightning during the regular season, with Tampa Bay’s lone victory coming in the final meeting. Pastrnak assisted on each of Boston’s first three goals and added another on Bergeron’s third-period goal, giving him 12 helpers in eight playoff games. Nash, meanwhile, got his second and third goals of the postseason, scoring on the power play at 17:11 of the opening period and 12:33 of the second to put the Bruins up, 3-1.
