 Dirk Nowitzki of the Dallas Mavericks had season-ending surgery on his left ankle Thursday, the team announced. A 39-year-old forward, Nowitzki elected to have the surgery now and miss the Mavericks’ final four regular-season games to begin the rehabilitation process as soon as possible. The Mavericks were eliminated from playoff contention nearly a month ago. In an interview with The New York Times last week, on the subject of returning for what would be a record 21st consecutive season with one team, Nowitzki said: “As of now, I’m planning to come back. I feel great. I’ve only missed one game all season. I signed a two-year contract because I wanted to play two more years. And here we are.” In a statement, the team said the procedure was a “surgical debridement of his left ankle.” The surgery is expected to improve Nowitzki’s chances of playing next season. Nowitzki, who turns 40 on June 19, averaged 12.0 points and 5.7 rebounds in 24.7 minutes per game this season and remained an efficient and effective offensive player despite his declining mobility. He ranks sixth on the N.B.A.’s career scoring list, just 232 points behind No. 5 Wilt Chamberlain (31,419). Nowitzki’s lateral movement, especially on defense, has been affected throughout the season by what the team has called a left ankle impingement. But he chose to play through the injury and appeared in 77 games, establishing a new league record for the most games played by an N.B.A. player in his 20th season. Kareem Abdul-Jabbar and Robert Parish shared the previous record of 74. Nowitzki will break a tie with Kobe Bryant, who spent 20 seasons with the Los Angeles Lakers, for the longest uninterrupted run with one N.B.A. franchise if he returns in 2018-19 for a 21st season. Nowitzki signed a two-year, $10 million contract last July.
