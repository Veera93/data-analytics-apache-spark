 Derek Jeter’s first inning as chief executive of the Miami Marlins did not quite go as planned. Jose Urena threw the first pitch of the 2018 baseball season. It was a four-seam fastball at 95 miles an hour. Ian Happ of the Cubs sent it in the other direction, for a home run to right. And it kind of got worse after that. Kris Bryant walked. Anthony Rizzo was hit by a pitch. After a couple of outs raised the Marlins’ hopes, Addison Russell also got hit by a pitch, to load the bases. Then Jason Heyward walked. Then Javier Baez got hit by a pitch, the third plunking of the inning by Urena. Cubs 3, Marlins 0, after one half-inning. The Marlins eventually made some noise at the plate but lost, 8-4. Of course, the early result can’t be a huge shock. The Cubs are a World Series favorite, and there is not a lot of hope for the Marlins, who traded the slugger Giancarlo Stanton in the off-season. Urena tied for first with 14 hit batsmen last season. Jeter’s first game as a player also was not auspicious. On May 29, 1995, he batted ninth for the Yankees against the Mariners. His first at-bat was a short flyout to right, and he wound up 0 for 5. Don Mattingly, the current Marlins manager, was playing first base for the Yankees.
