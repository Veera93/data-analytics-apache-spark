 COLUMBUS, Ohio — Teaira McCowan had 21 points and 25 rebounds to help Mississippi State reach the national championship game for the second straight year with a 73-63 overtime win over Louisville on Friday night. Down 3 points, Roshunda Johnson hit a 3-pointer from the wing to tie the score, 59-59, with seven seconds left in regulation. Louisville’s Myisha Hines-Allen then drove the length of the floor but missed a layup as time ran out with McCowan dogging her. In overtime, the Bulldogs asserted themselves, and Morgan William, who hit the game-winning shot in overtime last year in the Final Four to end UConn’s 111-game winning streak, made two free throws in the last minute to help Mississippi State (37-1) pull away. Louisville (36-3) managed just one basket on 10 shots in the extra period. McCowan, Mississippi State’s 6-foot-7 center, broke the rebounding mark set by Charlotte Smith of North Carolina in 1994 when she grabbed her 24th rebound. Asia Durr scored 18 for Louisville, which was making its third appearance in the Final Four. Jazmine Jones added 15. The loss ended a wonderful season for Louisville, which won the Atlantic Coast Conference regular season and conference tournament for the first time in team history. The Cardinals also earned the first No. 1 seed in program history as well.
