 INDIANAPOLIS — The Indianapolis Colts said that linebacker Edwin Jackson was one of two men killed early Sunday when a driver struck them as they stood outside their car along a highway in Indianapolis. The Colts said in a statement that the team was “heartbroken” by Jackson’s death. The statement said Jackson, 26, “was loved by all in the Colts organization.” The state police identified the victims as Jackson, who grew up in Atlanta, and 54-year-old Jeffrey Monroe, of Avon, Ind. The police said the two men were killed when a driver suspected of drunken driving struck them as they were standing along Interstate 70 on Indianapolis’s west side. The police said that it was believed that Monroe was a ride-sharing operator who was transporting Jackson when Jackson became ill. Monroe pulled over to the side of the highway and got out to help Jackson when both were struck by a pickup truck that also hit Monroe’s car, the police said. The driver of the pickup, a 37-year-old Indianapolis man, tried to flee on foot but was quickly captured, the state police said. The man was believed to be intoxicated and was driving without a license, the police said. The 6-foot, 234-pound Jackson attended Georgia Southern. He was signed by the Arizona Cardinals in May 2015 and released by the team about three months later. Jackson was signed to the Colts practice squad in December 2015 and then by the Colts to reserve/future contract in January 2016. He was placed on injured reserve at the beginning of the 2017 season. Many of Jackson’s teammates, as well as the owner Jim Irsay, expressed grief on social media Sunday.
