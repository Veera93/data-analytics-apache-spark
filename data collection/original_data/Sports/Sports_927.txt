 The Knicks announced Wednesday that they have agreed to trade the second-year center Willy Hernangomez to the Charlotte Hornets for two future second-round picks and the little-used forward Johnny O’Bryant. In the wake of a season-ending knee injury sustained Tuesday night by their star forward Kristaps Porzingis, Knicks officials decided to move quickly in the pursuit of future assets by striking a deal with Charlotte for Hernangomez. The key return for the Knicks in the trade is the addition of Charlotte’s second-round picks in 2020 and 2021. Despite his close friendship with Porzingis, Hernangomez, 23, has been hoping to be dealt to a new team after struggling to earn playing time with the Knicks this season. After a promising rookie campaign, Hernangomez appeared in only 26 of the Knicks’ 55 games this season, averaging 4.3 points and 2.6 rebounds in 9 minutes per game. As a rookie last season, Hernangomez averaged 8.2 points and 7.0 rebounds in 18.4 minutes per game and was named to the N.B.A.’s All-Rookie first team. The Knicks selected Hernangomez, a Spaniard, with the 35th pick in the 2015 draft.
