 The Rangers need goalie Henrik Lundqvist at his best to compete in the Eastern Conference playoff race. Against the Detroit Red Wings on Friday, Lundqvist was. He made 40 saves — many of the acrobatic variety — and thanks to Mats Zuccarello’s goal 37 seconds into overtime, the Rangers beat the Detroit Red Wings, 2-1, at Madison Square Garden. Zuccarello scored his fourth goal of the season, off assists from Brady Skjei and J.T. Miller, and the Rangers improved to 12-9-2 with their third straight victory and their ninth in 11 games. “I feel really good,” said Lundqvist, who won for the 416th time in his career. “There were chances both ways. To play the game was a lot of fun, but it was also challenging.” Zuccarello said Lundqvist’s playoff-level heroics were not a surprise. “We expect him to be like that every game,” he said. “If we can help him out, we know how good he can be.” Chris Kreider also scored for the Rangers, who extended their home winning streak to seven games. They are 9-4-2 overall at Madison Square Garden. The Rangers also continued their trend of stingy defense, allowing two or fewer goals for the fourth straight game and for the sixth time in their last seven contests. “A lot of people complain about low-scoring games, but for me anyway, this was as entertaining as it could get,” Rangers Coach Alain Vigneault said. Tomas Tatar scored for Detroit, and Jimmy Howard stopped 29 shots as the Red Wings fell to 10-9-4. Lundqvist made 17 saves in the opening period, plus a sprawling game-saver against Dylan Larkin at 11:58 of the third. “I’m trying to be on my toes right now,” said Lundqvist, who improved to 11-6-2 for the season. “I’m aggressive but still patient. Right now I’m in a nice flow where I don’t overthink things.”
