 The Yankees interviewed the broadcaster Aaron Boone for their managerial job on Friday. He was the fourth candidate to have met with the team. Boone, 44, a former Yankees third baseman who hit the home run that won the 2003 American League Championship Series for them, has never managed or coached professionally. “Look, obviously experience is very valuable and should be a check mark for somebody,” said Boone, whose father, Bob, managed for six seasons with Kansas City and Cincinnati. “I would also say I’ve been preparing for this job my entire life.”
