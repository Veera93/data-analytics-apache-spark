 KILLINGTON, Vt. — With an unrelenting charge in the final 100 yards, Viktoria Rebensburg of Germany on Saturday won her second consecutive World Cup giant slalom of the season, surging past the American Mikaela Shiffrin by 67-hundredths of a second. Four weeks ago, Rebensburg, the 2010 Olympic champion in giant slalom, also won the World Cup season-opening race in Sölden, Austria. “I knew I would have to push hard all the way to the bottom because I knew Mikaela would, and did,” said Rebensburg, who was the last racer out of the gate after Shiffrin had surged into the lead seconds earlier. Rebensburg’s winning time after two runs was 1 minute 57.63 seconds. Manuela Moelgg of Italy was in third place. For Shiffrin, Saturday’s runner-up finish was a comeback performance after a disappointing fifth place in Sölden. “This is a step in the right direction after Sölden,” said Shiffrin, last season’s winner of the women’s overall World Cup title. “I felt confident today.” Shiffrin blamed herself for the Sölden result, saying she had not raced with the same precision as she had in training, something she called a mental mistake. But, she said, coming from behind for a while may be to her advantage. “Right now, I’m still feeling like I’m chasing, which is my favorite place to be,” Shiffrin said. Shiffrin will have another opportunity for her first victory of the season on Sunday when she races in her specialty, the slalom. Shiffrin, whose formative years as a ski racer were spent in New England, will once again be the hometown favorite of the huge crowds that have flocked here to the Killington resort since last year, when World Cup racing returned to the Eastern United States for the first time in a quarter-century. On Saturday, Killington officials said the crowds that filled two grandstands numbered about 18,000, which would make the race one of the best attended on the women’s Alpine circuit in several years.
