 Update: High winds have postponed this event until Thursday morning Korea time. Mikaela Shiffrin begins her quest for multiple Olympic gold medals in the giant slalom. Initially a slalom specialist, Shiffrin has expanded her repertoire to become one of the best in the world in the giant slalom as well. “If all I did was the slalom, I’d have so much free time I might as well get another job, too,” she said. • Shiffrin’s biggest challenger is likely to be Viktoria Rebensburg of Germany, the 2010 winner and 2014 bronze medalist. (The defending champion, Tina Maze of Slovenia, is retired.) Another contender is Tessa Worley of France. • The women will ski two runs, with the winner determined by combined time. • Worley is the reigning world champion, beating Shiffrin by less than a second. Rebensburg has three World Cup giant slalom wins to Shiffrin’s two this season. • Shiffrin is set to ski seventh in the first run, after both Worley (fourth) and Rebensburg (sixth).
