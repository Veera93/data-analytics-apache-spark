 The Winter Olympics are less than three weeks away, and they need a little design help. As punishment for an elaborate doping scheme, any athletes from Russia competing in the Pyeongchang Games will wear neutral uniforms with a logo that identifies them as an “Olympic Athlete From Russia.” Olympics officials released this as a proposal, but surely there’s something better. In the meantime, on the Korean Peninsula, there’s suddenly a hint of harmony. North and South Korea will march together in the opening ceremony, under a unified flag, which looks like this. What should that flag look like? So Russian athletes need a logo and Korean athletes need a flag. If you are a professional graphic designer or an amateur doodler or a 3-year-old with a new box of crayons, let us see what you come up with. We may publish some of the submissions. Submissions must be received by February 9.
