 Jeremy Lin of the Brooklyn Nets is expected to miss the entire season after rupturing a tendon in his knee, the Nets announced Thursday. Lin, 29, landed hard after driving to the basket in the fourth quarter of Wednesday night’s opener against the Pacers in Indianapolis. He reacted with distress at the time, saying, “I’m done.” He finished with 18 points in 25 minutes. The Nets lost, 140-131. The diagnosis for Lin was a ruptured patella tendon of the right knee, the Nets said. “We feel awful that the injury will cost him the season, however our entire organization will be there to support Jeremy in every way possible throughout his recovery,” Nets General Manager Sean Marks said in a statement. “Jeremy remains an important part of this team and will continue to contribute in a leadership role.” An unheralded player out of Harvard, Lin exploded onto the N.B.A. scene in 2012 with a run of great performances with the Knicks that caused a fan movement known as Linsanity. He has since settled down to be a productive N.B.A. player, if not a superstar, with the Rockets, Lakers, and Hornets, before joining the Nets last season. He played only 36 games that season because of hamstring issues. Lin previously made news this season for his new dreadlocked hairstyle, which drew a critique from the former player Kenyon Martin, who charged him with wanting to “be black.” Lin was praised for his polite response, in which he pointed out that Martin had Chinese tattoos and said, “I think as minorities, the more we appreciate each other’s cultures the more we influence mainstream society.” It was the second season-ending injury to a notable N.B.A. player in two days. On Tuesday, Gordon Hayward, a key off-season signing for the Celtics, fractured a tibia and dislocated an ankle.
