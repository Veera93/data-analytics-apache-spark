 The N.F.L. will revisit its most controversial Super Bowl halftime show by having Justin Timberlake, the singer who participated in the infamous “wardrobe malfunction” of 2004, perform during Super Bowl LII. Timberlake, a Grammy Award-winning singer and songwriter, became famous with the boy band ’N Sync before going on to solo success with hits like “SexyBack,” “Cry Me a River” and “Rock Your Body.” While he has largely transitioned to acting, Timberlake recently had another hit with “Can’t Stop the Feeling” on the soundtrack for the animated movie “Trolls.” He also voiced the character Branch in the movie. Before his acting turn, Timberlake was part of the halftime shows for Super Bowls XXXV, in 2001, and XXXVIII, in 2004. At the performance for Super Bowl XXXVIII, which was held in Houston, he was on stage with Janet Jackson, and at the end of the performance he tore away part of Jackson’s top. The incident, which was later described as a “wardrobe malfunction,” led to numerous complaints and a hefty fine by the F.C.C. The fine was eventually vacated by an appeals court. During an interview televised during NBC’s Sunday Night Football broadcast, Mike Tirico asked Timberlake about whether the N.F.L. had addressed the incident with him. Timberlake smiled and said “That won’t happen this time.” Timberlake continues the N.F.L.’s trend toward courting a younger audience rather than going with older, safer performers. Other recent performers have included Lady Gaga, Beyoncé, Bruno Mars and Katy Perry.
