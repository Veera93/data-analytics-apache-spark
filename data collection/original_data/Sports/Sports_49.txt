   When the Atlanta Braves hired Alex Anthopoulos as general manager in November, action seemed likely to follow. The team needed help, having just endured a third consecutive season with at least 90 losses, and Anthopoulos had a knack for high-impact trades. But there were no deals for stars like Josh Donaldson, David Price or Troy Tulowitzki, who carried Toronto to a deep playoff run in 2015 after Anthopoulos acquired them as the Blue Jays’ general manager. In Atlanta, essentially, Anthopoulos simply waited for the season to start. He moved around some contracts in a deal with the Los Angeles Dodgers, for whom he had worked as an assistant the last two seasons, but that was about it. “I talked to some people that had gone through the same thing and they all, to a man, said, ‘In hindsight, I should have waited and given it a little bit of time,’” Anthopoulos said. “So the big thing was we weren’t going to trade any prospects at all, unless it was just an absolute no-brainer. And the challenging part about it was we may miss a window to sell high on a player. But the flip side was that there may be a player that wasn’t highly regarded that we may have traded who would have come back to bite us. So I do think it’ll balance out.” As an example, Anthopoulos cited outfielder Ronald Acuña Jr., who soared to the No. 1 overall spot in this year’s Baseball America prospect rankings, from 67th the year before. Acuña hit .325 with 21 homers and 44 runs batted in at three levels last season, and made his major league debut on Wednesday. He went 3 for 4 with a homer the next afternoon. Acuña is only 20, but he tore through spring training and seemed ready to start in the majors. He struggled in the minors, but hit safely in seven of eight games before his promotion.   “You try your best to call these guys up at a time when they’re hot and playing well, so they’re in a good place mentally, and also when you feel, developmentally, they’re here to stay,” Anthopoulos said. “That’ll be up to him, but in terms of expectations: Play good defense, play hard, have good at-bats. What the results are going to be, who knows? But if he does those things, he’s going to be a productive player.” By waiting a few weeks to call up Acuña, the Braves ensured that he would not collect a full year of service time, meaning they control his rights through 2024. Acuña is part of a young core that includes four other everyday players under 30 — second baseman Ozzie Albies, first baseman Freddie Freeman, center fielder Ender Inciarte and shortstop Dansby Swanson — and several promising pitchers. But the Braves’ flow of young talent came with some sludge. Their previous general manager, John Coppolella, was banned for life in November for violating international signing rules. Major League Baseball declared 13 of Atlanta’s prospects to be free agents, removed the Braves’ third-round choice in the 2018 draft, and severely restricted their international bonus allotment until 2022. “I think everyone views what happened as a one-off,” Anthopoulos said. “I don’t think people link the organization, specifically, to what happened. There’s a lot of great people here and a lot of great things have been done here. It was addressed, it was dealt with, and it’s over. You’re not going to ever hear me say, ‘Woe is us,’ because every club has challenges and no one wants to hear excuses. You’re hired to get it right, so embrace the upside, embrace the positives — and there are a ton of them here.” The Braves, who will start a three-game series with Mets at Citi Field on Tuesday, have lost only one series so far and entered the weekend with a 14-10 record. Anthopoulos said he was especially encouraged by the team’s run differential (+30 through Thursday), which could be significant. Three years ago, when the Blue Jays had a middling record, their strong run differential persuaded Anthopoulos to fortify the roster in July. Now, after signing the former Blue Jays slugger Jose Bautista to a minor league deal in hopes that he can play third base, Anthopoulos may take a similar approach. “From a front-office standpoint, it’s our responsibility to support the players,” he said. “It’s still very early, but as we go on into the summer, if they continue to show us we’re a good team, a competitive team, we’ll look to go out and add, if we can. We’re a long way from that, but if they do, we’ve shown in the past that we’ll be willing to do that.” On a bus in Japan in 2011, while conducting baseball clinics on a State Department good-will tour, Cal Ripken finally found someone who could relate to his greatest achievement. Ripken, the Hall of Fame infielder for the Baltimore Orioles, played in a record 2,632 consecutive games. On the bus was Sachio Kinugasa, who played 2,215 games in a row for the Hiroshima Carp. They had met before, but they bonded in Kinugasa’s home country, which had just been devastated by a tsunami.  Kinugasa died on Monday, at age 71, and Ripken, who was conducting clinics in Prague, was eager to discuss their friendship in a phone call. “There wasn’t anybody that had played that many games that I could talk to, and it was fun to talk about the challenges and how he looked at it, and how his approach was pretty similar to mine: Basically as a baseball player, it was his responsibility to come to the ballpark and play — and he did, and that was refreshing,” Ripken said. “The demands, learning what you’re capable of, finding that you could play with an injury and be successful — that was part of the battle. You’re always playing at somewhat less than 100 percent, and it was fun having someone to relate to that — you get hit with a pitch in the hand, you get hit with a pitch in the elbow, you don’t have feeling in your fingers when you throw a baseball, and somehow you figure out how to get through that.” Ripken passed Lou Gehrig’s major league record of 2,130 straight games in September 1995. The next June in Kansas City, when Ripken played in his 2,216th consecutive game, Kinugasa was there to greet him.  Ripken fondly recalled Kinugasa’s passion for the game. “There was a kidlike presence about him,” Ripken said. “He almost seemed to be enjoying the clinics and the interaction with the kids as much as the kids were. He was laughing and he had a big smile on his face. He had a youthful persona that was really cool to see.” Kinugasa, who played mostly on the infield corners, hit 504 career home runs over 23 seasons, all with Hiroshima. He started his streak in late 1970 and played every game of a 130-game schedule through his retirement in 1987. Entering the weekend, the majors’ longest active streak of consecutive games, according to the Elias Sports Bureau, was 355 by Alcides Escobar of the Kansas City Royals. With teams paying more and more attention to rest, Ripken’s record is secure. “I think nowadays the definition of an everyday player is not 162 games, it’s something less,” Ripken said. “But that could change. I feel really good that certain players want to test themselves and see if they could play 162, and I admire that — because even if you play 150, you’re still going to have the same mental toughness about playing every day and the same physical challenges where you’re playing less than 100 percent. The 12-game difference is not much of a difference than pushing through and playing every one.”  Evan Mathis made his mark on professional football over 12 seasons, earning two Pro Bowl selections as a guard for the Philadelphia Eagles and winning a Super Bowl with the Denver Broncos. Now he has made baseball history, in a way. On Monday, Mathis sold his 1952 Topps Mickey Mantle rookie card for $2.88 million through Heritage Auctions, which called it a record price for a post-World War II trading card. The card was graded a nine by Professional Sports Authenticator, making it one of only six 1952 Mantle cards — out of more than 1,500 graded — with that distinction. Just three are known to rate a perfect 10. “If we had a time machine and went back to 1952 to open boxes of Topps cards, we’d run into a lot of off-center, mis-cut, and poorly printed cards,” Mathis said in an email interview. “A card making it out of the factory in mint condition was already hard enough. And for that mint card to have survived all of this time since then really sets it apart from the rest. There’s just something about pieces of history that have withstood the test of time that has always been appealing to me.” Mathis, 36, started collecting at age 6, hunting for Bo Jackson cards. The hobby was booming back then — but not in a good way, at least for return on investment. “The ’80s and ’90s are referred to as the ‘junk wax’ era because of how massively overproduced everything was,” Mathis said. “There were a lot of people buying cards, and as a result, a lot of people not getting a great R.O.I. on what they were putting in. Naturally, this led a lot of people away from the hobby, as does simply growing up.” When Mathis grew up, though, he found himself drawn back to the hobby by purchasing boxes of vintage cards and searching for those with high grades. The Mantle was his prize, and while he did not say exactly how much he paid for it, he did not strike it rich with the auction. “I owned the Mantle for two years, and my cost basis was pretty close to what it brought at auction, so it’s not like I won the lottery or anything,” Mathis said. “I freed up some money to buy a house and gave myself some liquidity to do some more buying and selling of cards. I enjoy buying collections and going through them to cherry-pick the cards that need to get graded.” Mathis, who interacts with other collectors at selltoevan.com, has made collecting his primary pursuit since retiring after the 2016 season. His current centerpiece is a 1953 Topps Mantle card with a 10 grade, which is painfully close to his Holy Grail: the same card he just auctioned, but with a perfect 10. “I can’t afford it now,” Mathis said, “but I’ve always liked to think big.” As the Los Angeles Angels returned to Anaheim for a six-game home stand with the Yankees and the Baltimore Orioles, Albert Pujols needed six hits to reach 3,000 for his career. That would give him a unique distinction in major league history. Pujols, who reached 600 homers last season, will join Hank Aaron, Willie Mays and Alex Rodriguez as the only players with 600 home runs and 3,000 hits. But Pujols has something the three others do not: multiple World Series titles. The others won just one apiece: Aaron with the 1957 Milwaukee Braves, Mays with the 1954 New York Giants and Rodriguez with the 2009 Yankees. Pujols won with the St. Louis Cardinals in 2006 and 2011. Pujols also has the highest career on-base plus slugging percentage of the group, at .945, with Mays next at .941. But that figure could drop before Pujols, 38, retires. He is signed through 2021, and, entering the weekend, his O.P.S. across seven seasons with the Angels was just .776. Peter Gammons was 61 years old in 2006 when he was seized by a terrible headache on his way to the gym near his home on Cape Cod. Gammons, a winner of the writers’ award at the Baseball Hall of Fame, was airlifted to a Boston hospital and underwent surgery to treat a brain aneurysm. Two and a half months later, he was back to work at ESPN. Gammons, who now writes for The Athletic, reached out recently to Danny Farquhar, the White Sox reliever who suffered a ruptured brain aneurysm in the dugout during a game in Chicago on April 20. He sent a message of support on Twitter and contacted the White Sox, offering to share his experiences with Farquhar’s family. “I know from my wife that the first couple of days, even though the doctor had gone through my skull and clamped the aneurysm, she and the rest of my family still didn’t know what it was going to be like when the recovery’s over,” Gammons said. “There’s a period of uncertainty and a lot of doubt. I just wanted to say to them, ‘Hey, I’ve been through this, this is what happens, and you will come back.’” On Monday, in their most recent update on his condition, the White Sox said that Farquhar was in critical, but neurologically stable, condition in the intensive care unit at Rush University Medical Center after surgery. The team said he had use of his extremities, could speak and was responding appropriately to questions and commands from doctors. Farquhar was expected to remain in the I.C.U. for the next few weeks, according to the White Sox, who placed him on the 60-day disabled list. Farquhar is 31, and Gammons believes that his physical condition could help his chances for recovery. “I think it will, because he’s strong and he’s in incredible shape,” Gammons said. “People who are in pretty good shape, and whose bodies can withstand shock, have a better chance of returning to normal.”  Gammons said he would like to visit Farquhar, who has a wife and three children, when Farquhar is out of the hospital. “I’ve never met Lexie, his wife, but I’ve always liked Danny a lot,” Gammons said. “I would just want to tell her that this is not the end of the world, and he can still have a great life.”
