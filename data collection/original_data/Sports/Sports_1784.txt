 Deontay Wilder knocked out the only man who had ever gone the distance with him, sending Bermane Stiverne to the canvas three times in the opening round Saturday night at Barclays Center to retain his W.B.C. heavyweight title. Wilder entered the ring wearing a gold cape and a mask. He scowled for the 2 minutes 59 seconds the fight lasted. Wilder won the belt from Stiverne in 2015 in a 12-round decision. He repeatedly insisted that Stiverne would go down early in this one. Wilder kept his word. He is 39-0 with 38 knockouts. Wilder, 32, jabbed through much of the first round, while Stiverne, who had not fought in two years, moved slowly and cautiously around the ring. Suddenly, Wilder lashed out with a huge right that felled Stiverne (25-3-1). Already, Wilder was celebrating, but Stiverne got up. Unwisely, it turned out, because another big right as part of a flurry of punches sent the 38-year-old challenger back down. At that point, Wilder climbed atop the ropes in a neutral corner, shouting at Stiverneâ€™s trainer to end things. When that did not happen, another right and then a mammoth left hook sent down the challenger for the final time. Wilder now can set his sights on something he has been promising throughout 2017: unifying the heavyweight belts.
