 When I was 7, my second-grade teacher assigned a project called “Christmas Is …” We each made a little book and filled every page with a different way to finish that sentence. Christmas is giving, Christmas is love, Christmas is Santa, and so on. On one of my pages, I wrote “Christmas is Manny Trillo’s birthday” — which it was, of course. How did I know that? I was crazy about baseball, and he was the second baseman for my local team, the Philadelphia Phillies. How could I not know his birthday? Retaining such trivia, I soon realized, was not normal. But what can I tell you? When baseball tidbits go into my brain, they usually don’t come out. I don’t know why this is, but at least I’ve made a career out of it. So here is my gift to you, the baseball fan in winter: a wide-ranging trivia quiz to enjoy with that holiday egg nog. I made it 50 questions long, mostly because baseball fans like round numbers, but also to honor Charlie Morton of the Houston Astros, who wore No. 50 while closing out the seventh game of this year’s World Series at Dodger Stadium. Morton got a ground ball to second base — Trillo’s position. Happy birthday, old friend, and warmest greetings to all! Answers are below the quiz. Paths to the Hall of Fame 1.
