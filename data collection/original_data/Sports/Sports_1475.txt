 MEXICO CITY — Caris LeVert scored 21 points, Rondae Hollis-Jefferson added 17 and the short-handed Nets overcame another strong performance by Russell Westbrook to beat the Oklahoma City Thunder, 100-95, on Thursday night in the first of the Nets’ two games in Mexico City. Westbrook had 31 points, eight rebounds and six assists. Allen Crabbe had 15 points and six rebounds for Brooklyn, as the team played without power forward Trevor Booker after he was traded to Philadelphia before the game. The Nets were also without Sean Kilpatrick, a guard who was waived earlier in the day to accommodate the trade. Jahlil Okafor and Nik Stauskas, the players acquired for Booker, will eventually join the Nets to help fill out the roster, but on Thursday it was a group effort that slowed down the star-studded Thunder. The Nets improved to 10-14 with their second straight victory and third in four games. They will play the Miami Heat on Saturday at Arena Ciudad de Mexico. The Thunder (11-13) had won three in a row. Steven Adams added 12 points for the Thunder, and Carmelo Anthony had 11 on 5-for-20 shooting. Oklahoma City was also short-handed, as they played without Paul George (right calf contusion) and Jerami Grant (left hip contusion).
