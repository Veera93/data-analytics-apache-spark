 SAN DIEGO — Starter Jason Vargas had a rough debut with the Mets on Saturday, five weeks after breaking a bone in his glove hand in spring training. The left-hander allowed nine runs and nine hits, four for extra bases, in three and two-third innings as the Mets lost, 12-2, to the San Diego Padres. Vargas, 35, tied for the major league lead with 18 wins last year with Kansas City. On Saturday, he gave up three walks in addition to the nine hits and he struck out five. The Padres’ Franchy Cordero hit a three-run homer estimated at 453 feet, Christian Villanueva had a two-run shot, and Austin Hedges drove in a career-high five runs. The rookie lefthander Joey Lucchesi (3-1) limited the Mets to four hits in five and two-third innings while striking out six and walking two. He exited two batters after surrendering a two-run homer to Yoenis Cespedes that sailed into the Padres’ bullpen beyond the fence in center field. Hedges, the light-hitting catcher, came up big with a two-run single in the third, a two-run double in the fourth and an R.B.I. single in the sixth. He raised his average from .143 to .176. Villanueva extended his hitting streak to 11 games hit a two-run homer to left-center with one out in the first, his eighth. He was robbed of another two-run shot when Juan Lagares made a nice leaping catch against the fence in left-center. Cordero homered to right-center with two outs in the fourth to give the Padres a 9-0 lead and chase Vargas. The homer was his sixth of the season and his third of more than 450 feet, the most in the big leagues this year.
