 Kristaps Porzingis returned after a one-game absence to score 34 points to lead the Knicks over the visiting Sacramento Kings, 118-91, on Saturday night. Courtney Lee added 20 points, and Enes Kanter had 17 points and 13 rebounds for the Knicks, who have won four straight at Madison Square Garden. They led by as many as 33 points in the fourth quarter. Skal Labissiere scored 19 points and Buddy Hield 17 for the Kings. Porzingis missed Wednesday night’s road loss against Orlando because of ankle and elbow injuries. The Kings got within one point on three occasions in the second quarter, the last time with 6 minutes 54 seconds remaining, when Hield’s jumper made the score 43-42. The Knicks then took off on a 21-7 run, capped by four straight points from Porzingis, and led by 64-49 at halftime. Porzingis, 22, who entered the game as the N.B.A.’s second-leading scorer, went 11 of 21 from the field, including 3 for 4 from 3-point range. He strung together six straight points to put the Knicks ahead by 74-53 with 8:38 left in the third quarter as fans serenaded him with “M.V.P.” chants. He went to the bench for good with the Knicks leading, 88-60, late in the third. The Knicks started slowly, missing five straight shots and turning the ball over twice as the Kings jumped out to a 10-0 lead. The Knicks closed out the opening period on a 32-13 run, highlighted by 16 points from Porzingis.
