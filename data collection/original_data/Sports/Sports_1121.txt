 NEW PORT RICHEY, Fla. — An autopsy report says that the retired baseball pitcher Roy Halladay had evidence of an amphetamine, morphine and an insomnia drug in his system when he died in a small plane crash in Florida last year. The Tampa Bay Times reported that an autopsy released on Friday showed that Halladay, a two-time Cy Young Award winner for the Toronto Blue Jays and the Philadelphia Phillies, died from blunt force trauma — with drowning as a contributing factor — when he crashed his personal plane into the Gulf of Mexico near here on Nov. 7. The National Transportation Safety Board has not identified a cause of the crash. A witness told investigators that Halladay’s ICON A5 had climbed to between 300 and 500 feet before it went into a 45-degree dive and slammed into the water. The body of Halladay, 40, was found in the wreckage. No one else was aboard the plane.
