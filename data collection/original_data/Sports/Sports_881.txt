 PYEONGCHANG, South Korea — More than 100 gold medals — 102 to be exact — will be awarded in 15 different sports at these Winter Games in Pyeongchang. Each one, of course, is special for the athlete who wins it. Only Charlotte Kalla, the Swedish cross-country champion who took the  7.5km + 7.5km skiathlon under a bright, crisp sky Saturday afternoon, will be able to say that she won the first gold medal of the Olympiad, the first gold medal in a Winter Games in South Korea.  The 15-kilometer race is really two races in one. Skiers ski the first half in the classic style, keeping their skis in parallel tracks and powering over the course with their poles. After 7.5 kilometers, they switch skis and ski the rest of the race in skate style.  The point of the race is to determine the best all-around skier. Not only do skiers have to be able to ski both styles, the race isn’t a sprint and it isn’t a marathon. It’s the ultimate cross-country test.  Kalla won the gold medal in the women’s 15 kilometer skiathlon with a classy effort, putting away the favorite, Marit Bjoergen of Norway, No. 8 above, in the final third of the race. The American Jessica Diggins, No. 3 below, finished fifth, 15 seconds back. Kalla has done this before. It was the third Olympic gold medal of her career. But it will always be Pyeongchang’s first.
