 ORLANDO, Fla. — Nikola Vucevic scored 24 points and Evan Fournier added 23 to help the Orlando Magic beat the Knicks, minus Kristaps Porzingis, 112-99 on Wednesday night. Jonathon Simmons scored 15 of his 16 points in the second half. His surge came at just the right time as he scored 11 straight points early in the fourth quarter, which pushed the Magic’s lead into double figures. The Magic, benefiting from the return of starting point guard Elfrid Payton, ended a two-game losing streak. The Knicks, playing without Porzingis, who is dealing with injuries to his ankle and elbow, had their three-game winning streak come to an end. In Porzingis’s absence, Tim Hardaway Jr. was the Knicks’ only consistent scoring threat, and he had 26 points and 11 rebounds in 38 minutes. The Knicks’ second-leading scorer was Doug McDermott, who had 13 points off the bench. The Knicks entered the game having won six of their last seven games, but they seemed out of sync offensively without Porzingis. They shot 53 percent from the field but committed 23 turnovers. Thanks to Payton’s return, the Magic showed improvement on offense. They shot 54 percent from the field and 46 percent from 3-point range, mainly on the strength of spacing that Payton provided. He had missed eight straight games because of a hamstring injury, but finished with 11 points, 11 assists and six rebounds in his first game back. Aaron Gordon also came through for the Magic with 21 points. He was 4 for 6 from 3-point range and 8 for 11 from the field after a few signature alley-oop passes from Payton.
