 MANCHESTER, England — Sevilla reached the Champions League quarterfinals for the first time after beating Manchester United, 2-1, on Tuesday behind two second-half goals from the substitute Wissam Ben Yedder. Ben Yedder scored in the 74th minute — two minutes after coming on — with a low shot from 12 yards out, and then sent in a header off a corner that United goalkeeper David De Gea could only parry into his own net in the 78th. That left United behind by 2-0 on aggregate, and needing three goals to advance because of the away-goals rule. Romelu Lukaku pulled one back from close range in the 84th but a late rally couldn’t prevent United slipping out of the competition. Ben Yedder, a former futsal player for France, has eight goals in this season’s competition, and he even missed a chance for a hat trick as United’s defense fell apart in the latter stages. Only Real Madrid’s Cristiano Ronaldo — with 12 goals — has more. Sevilla last reached the round of 8 of the competition in 1958, when it was called the European Cup. It joins fellow Spanish team Real Madrid in Friday’s draw for the quarterfinal round. In the afternoon’s other Champions League match, Roma overcame a poor first-half performance to beat Shakhtar Donetsk, 1-0, and advanced on the away goals rule after a 2-2 aggregate score. Edin Dzeko scored the only goal of the match early in the second half. Roma became the second Italian club to progress to the final eight after Juventus beat Tottenham last week. Shakhtar led 2-1 from the first leg and would have advanced with a draw, but its hopes of an equalizer diminished 11 minutes from time when defender Ivan Ordets was sent off for hauling down Dzeko.
