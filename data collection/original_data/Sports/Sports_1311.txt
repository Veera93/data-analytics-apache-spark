 CHICAGO — Kris Dunn scored 17 points, including two crucial free throws in the final seconds, and the surging Chicago Bulls rallied to beat the Knicks, 92-87, on Wednesday night. Chicago trailed by as many as 15 in the first half, but shut down the Knicks down the stretch for a ninth win in its last 11 games. The Knicks managed just 3 points in the final five and a half minutes. Kristaps Porzingis led the Knicks with 23 points, and Courtney Lee had 17. The Knicks have lost three straight. Lauri Markkanen scored 12 points for the Bulls, and Justin Holiday and Robin Lopez had 11 points each. Holiday also made three of Chicago’s 10 3-pointers in 28 attempts, compared to a 4-for-23 performance from beyond the arc for the Knicks. The Knicks led for most of the night before Holiday hit a corner 3-pointer that tied the score at 86-86 with 3 minutes 1 second left. Neither team scored for the next two-plus minutes before Dunn found Markkanen ahead of the field for a dunk. Jarrett Jack was fouled with 8.5 seconds left and had a chance to tie it, but converted just 1 of 2 free throws. Dunn was fouled with 7.8 seconds to go and made both for a 90-87 lead. Following a timeout, Enes Kanter’s 3-point attempt missed badly and bounced out of bounds. Holiday then sealed the game with a pair of free throws.
