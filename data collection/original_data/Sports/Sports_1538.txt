 Major League Baseball took a formal step toward welcoming a distinctive new star on Friday, ratifying a posting agreement that frees its teams to court Shohei Ohtani, a pitching and hitting sensation who is leaving Japan’s Nippon Professional Baseball League. Ohtani, 23, can now negotiate with major league teams through Dec. 22. As a final precursor to Ohtani’s free agency, baseball owners unanimously approved the new agreement with Japanese baseball in a conference call Friday morning. However, it does not go into effect until Nov. 1, 2018. As a result, Ohtani will still be subject to the previous agreement, established in 2013, in which a team must give $20 million to the player’s Japanese team, which in the case of Ohtani is the  Nippon Ham Fighters. Ohtani has widespread appeal to major league teams because of his talent and the low cost attached to obtaining him — a direct result of his eagerness to jump to the majors. Because Ohtani is not yet 25, and has only five seasons in professional baseball, he is subject to baseball’s international bonus-pool system, which limits him to a bonus of no more than $3.55 million from a major league team and a rookie contract at the minimum of $545,000 next season. After the new posting agreement takes effect next November, it will run through October 2021. Under it, the fee paid to a player’s former Japanese team will change. For guaranteed contracts worth less than $25 million, the major league team will pay 20 percent of that value to the team in Japan. The percentages then decrease incrementally as the guaranteed money in the contract rise
