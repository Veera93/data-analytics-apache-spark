 After receiving a diagnosis of prostate cancer, Scott Blackmun, the chief executive of the United States Olympic Committee, announced he would not travel to South Korea for the opening ceremony of the Olympics next month. Blackmun broke the news to U.S.O.C. staff members with an email on Monday. In the email, he said that his doctors had recommended he seek immediate treatment, and that in all likelihood he would not be able to travel to Pyeongchang even after the opening ceremony, which will be held on Feb. 9. No changes in the power structure of the U.S.O.C. are expected. The 60-year-old Blackmun became the chief executive of the U.S.O.C. in 2010. He had previously served as the organization’s interim chief in 2000, following the firing of Norman Blake, but in 2001 he lost out on the permanent position to Lloyd Ward, a former chairman of Maytag. Once Blackmun regained the C.E.O. position, he prioritized repairing a troubled relationship with the International Olympic Committee. In 2011 he was appointed to the I.O.C.’s marketing commission, and his efforts, and the efforts of Larry Probst, the chairman of the U.S.O.C., to get the United States back in the I.O.C.’s good graces paid off when Los Angeles was awarded the 2028 Summer Games.
