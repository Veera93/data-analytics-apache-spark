 CHICAGO — The Washington Capitals’ Devante Smith-Pelly, a visiting black player, was taunted by four male fans shouting “basketball, basketball, basketball” Saturday night during the Chicago Blackhawks’ game against the Capitals. Smith-Pelly was serving a major penalty for fighting Chicago’s Connor Murphy when the fans taunted him in the penalty box. An off-ice official sitting next to Pelly-Smith notified building security, and the fans were ejected. “We were made aware of an incident at tonight’s game involving a small group of attendees who made harmful comments directed at Washington Capitals player Devante Smith-Pelly,” the Blackhawks said in a statement. “The fans were immediately removed and we apologize to Smith-Pelly and the Washington Capitals organization. We are committed to providing an inclusive environment for everyone who attends our games and these actions will never be tolerated.” Smith-Pelly was not available for comment. Capitals Coach Barry Trotz said the player was “a little upset.” “There’s absolutely no place in the game of hockey or our country for racism,” Trotz said. “I think it’s disgusting.” Smith-Pelly, 25, is in his first season with the Capitals. He also has played for Anaheim, Montreal and New Jersey.
