 Kyle Korver, the veteran sharpshooter for the Cleveland Cavaliers, will take a leave of absence from the team following the death of his brother, Kirk. “We are very sad to share that Cavaliers guard Kyle Korver’s brother, Kirk, passed away today,” the Cavaliers said in a statement issued late Tuesday night. “Kyle has been excused from the team to be with his family. We extend our deepest condolences and heartfelt best to Kyle and his entire family as they go through this very difficult time.” Kyle Korver missed a game against the Chicago Bulls on Saturday, a 114-109 Cavaliers win, for what the team called “personal reasons,” which Cleveland.com reported was a trip to Iowa to visit Kirk, who had become ill last week. Kirk’s illness was not identified, but Kyle returned to the team and played 28 minutes in a win over the Milwaukee Bucks on Monday. The Korvers are a basketball family, with all four brothers having played at the college level. In a 2012 interview, Kirk Korver raved about the advantages that came along with that. “It was great,” he said. “I always had someone to play with; it was four of us — very competitive. We had a lot of space at the house for basketball and football.” Kyle, at 37, is the oldest of the brothers. Kirk, the youngest, was 27, and had played at the University of Missouri-Kansas City for four years He was limited by injuries in 2013-2014, his senior year, and started just one game, but finished his career with the fourth-most games played in the program’s history, with 113. No timetable was given for Kyle Korver’s absence, but he is at the very least expected to miss Cleveland’s game against the Toronto Raptors on Wednesday. The Cavaliers’ bench may be remarkably thin for the game against the Eastern Conference-leading Raptors, with Larry Nance Jr. and Cedi Osman already having been declared out and Rodney Hood and Tristan Thompson being questionable with injuries.
