 BOSTON — Terry Rozier filled in nicely for Kyrie Irving, logging his first career triple-double in his first N.B.A. start to lead the Boston Celtics to a 103-73 victory over the Knicks on Wednesday night at TD Garden. Rozier collected 17 points, 11 rebounds and 10 assists to become just the second player in N.B.A. history to record a triple-double in his first start, joining Tony Wroten for Philadelphia on Nov. 13, 2013, according to Elias Sports Bureau. Irving was sidelined by a right quadriceps contusion after being injured during Monday’s victory in Denver. Marcus Morris scored 21 points for Boston, and Jayson Tatum had 15. Al Horford and Jaylen Brown each added 14. The Knicks, trying to win their third game in a row, were led by Enes Kanter, who had 17 points and 17 rebounds, and Kristaps Porzingis, who chipped in with 16 points. Porzingis added three blocked shots, the 20th straight game he has recorded a block. The Knicks were again without guard Ron Baker, who will be out indefinitely after a magnetic resonance imaging examination showed a dislocation and torn labrum of his right shoulder. Baker injured his shoulder on Tuesday against the Nets and did not travel to Boston. Morris left in the final minute of the third quarter when he landed hard after a dunk, sustaining a bruised left hip. Boston carried a 50-45 lead into halftime and grabbed control by outscoring the Knicks by 31-20 in the third quarter. The Knicks trailed by as many as 33 in the closing period. Rozier had 11 first-quarter points as the Celtics took a 27-24 after the first quarter. The teams split their first two meetings this season, with the Celtics winning 110-89 on Oct. 24 in Boston and the Knicks prevailing 102-93 on Dec. 21 in New York.
