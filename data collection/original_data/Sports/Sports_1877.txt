 Tiger Woods pleaded guilty to reckless driving on Friday and will be put on probation for a year and attend a rehabilitation program. Woods, 41, made the plea in Palm Beach Gardens, Fla. Woods was found by a police officer asleep at the wheel of his parked Mercedes in May. Woods had “extremely slow and slurred speech,” a police report said. He was “sluggish, sleepy and unable to walk alone.” Woods struggled with sobriety tests at the scene and was later found to have five drugs in his system, including Vicodin, Xanax and Ambien, but no alcohol. Woods said in a statement afterward that he had an “unexpected reaction to prescribed medications” and apologized. He checked into a clinic in June to deal with problems with prescription medications. If Woods successfully completes the diversion program, which includes attending D.U.I. school and performing community service, a more serious driving under the influence charge will be dropped from his record. He will have to undergo regular drug tests. Richard Clausi, an assistant state attorney, told Reuters that Woods could perform the community service with the Tiger Woods Foundation, if he chose to. Woods was cited with careless driving in 2009 after he crashed his car into a tree outside his house. Soon after, he and his wife divorced. After 16 months off because of back problems, he returned to golf in December. But by February, back spasms caused him to stop playing again. He had a back operation in April and has not returned. His last major win was in 2008, at the United States Open. With 14 majors, he stands second on the career list, behind Jack Nicklaus’s 18. He last won on the PGA Tour in 2013.
