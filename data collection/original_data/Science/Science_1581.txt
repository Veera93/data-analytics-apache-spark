 Baby food is sold in every country on Earth, but in poor and middle-income countries, its quality is completely unpredictable, a new study has found. Children would be healthier if an international agency tested brands and certified them as nutritious, the study’s authors argued. “Some of these products are fine, but some are just awful, and there’s no way for consumers to tell the difference,” said William A. Masters, an economist with the Friedman School of Nutrition Science and Policy at Tufts University and the study’s lead author. “A wonderful food category is languishing for lack of quality certification.” His team tested 108 brands of infant porridge from 22 countries and found that less than a quarter met international standards for fat, protein, iron and zinc. The study is to be published soon in the journal Maternal and Child Nutrition. It would be relatively easy for a laboratory to collect samples, test them and issue seals of quality that the makers could display on their packages, Dr. Masters said. His team simply wired $20 payments to friends and colleagues around the world to cover the cost of shipping samples to Boston. On-site plant inspections, of course, would cost more. Why this problem was not solved long ago is puzzling, Dr. Masters said. A reason, he surmised, “could be prejudice in the public-sector nutrition community.” Nutrition advocates endorse some expensive additives like micronutrient sprinkles and fortified peanut butters, he said. Yet they often demonize packaged foods from private companies, even though they are cheap and popular, because of the extra salt and sugar in adult foods and because of the long battle to keep women breast-feeding instead of using formula from food companies like Nestlé. As long as porridges are used only to supplement breast-feeding for children over 6 months old, and as long as they contain proper levels of nutrients, he argued, “they can be lifesavers.”
