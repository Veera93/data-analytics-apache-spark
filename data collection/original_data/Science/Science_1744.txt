 ■ There are about 44 million donkeys worldwide. They evolved from the African wild ass, which is critically endangered. As few as 600 may exist in Ethiopia, Eritrea and Somalia. Donkeys can live well into their 40s. ■ Male donkeys are called jacks, and females are called jennets. ■ Donkeys have 62 chromosomes and horses 64, but they can interbreed. A mule is the offspring of a male donkey and a female horse, and a hinny is the offspring of a male horse and female donkey. Mules and hinnies can be male or female, but are almost always infertile. Mules are bred far more often than hinnies because male donkey/female horse pairings are about as successful as horses breeding with horses, a rate of about 65 percent. The rate for male horse/female donkey pairings is much lower although experts say it is hard to pin down. Most female donkeys never conceive when mated with a stallion, but the rare exceptions don’t seem to have much trouble. ■ In the United States, wild donkeys are often called burros, the Spanish word for donkeys. Almost 12,000 wild burros roam ranges in the United States, and about another 1,000 are kept in corrals, according to the Bureau of Land Management, which is responsible for them. ■ In America, the term “ass” elicits giggles. In British English, “arse” is the slang word for buttocks or anus. Ass is used to describe a donkey or a fool. The words have different origins. Arse comes from the Old English “aers,” related to Dutch and German words. Ass from the Old English “assa,” which comes from a Celtic word that was based on the Latin “asinus.” ■ A donkey’s bray is made by breathing in and out. The animal breathes in on the hee and out on the haw.
