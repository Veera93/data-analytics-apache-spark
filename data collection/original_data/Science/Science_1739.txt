 Q. Why don’t stores in Europe refrigerate eggs? A. Eggs sold at retail stores in the United States and Europe are handled differently, said Randy W. Worobo, a professor of food science at Cornell University, making the Salmonella risks to consumers different. Salmonella enteritidis infections from consuming eggs can cause serious illness in susceptible people. In the United States, the Department of Agriculture requires egg producers to clean and sanitize eggs, Dr. Worobo said. “The washing removes both dirt and fecal matter that might contain salmonella from the exterior,” he said, “but at the same time, it removes a thin outer protective layer.” In Europe, where washing is not required, the eggs still have that protective film, he said, preventing salmonella from infiltrating the egg’s interior and making refrigeration unnecessary. After United States eggs are washed, they must be kept at a surrounding air temperature that does not exceed 45 degrees Fahrenheit. This prevents condensation from building up on the egg and allowing any Salmonella on the exterior to penetrate the shell and contaminate the interior, Dr. Worobo said. The refrigeration also prevents the growth of any Salmonella from the reproductive tract of the hen that may already be inside the egg. question@nytimes.com
