 Q. Why would cats be more finicky about their food than dogs, which have a more acute sense of smell? A. Behavioral explanations have been suggested for the tendency of many domestic cats to be so picky about their diets. As mostly solitary hunters rather than pack animals, like dogs, cats don’t have to wolf their food down to be sure to get their share. An overindulgent owner, too, may take a perverse pride in a cat’s epicurean tastes and cater to it. And what cats are fed as young kittens, both through mother’s milk and early solids, may lead to lifelong preferences. Food characteristics play a role, as well. Although cats are not as sensitive to smell as dogs, aroma is still very important to them, so cold food may meet with a turned-up nose. Texture is another consideration. Cats’ teeth can rip and tear, but aren’t as good at grinding, so moist chunks and shreds are often preferred to dry food, which tends to be swallowed whole. Some research suggests that the underlying reasons for rejecting certain foods may be genetic. A 2005 study in the journal PLOS/Genetics found, for example, that cats appear to lack the genes for taste receptors for sweetness, making them indifferent to sweet foods. They have evolved with a general preference for protein, which is essential to their health, and may be more likely to ignore carbohydrates. Moreover, they may have far more sensitive receptors than humans for certain bitter flavors, a more recent study in the journal BMC Neuroscience found, another reason for a discriminating taste.
