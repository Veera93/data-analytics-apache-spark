 Constipation may increase the risk for kidney disorders, new research has found. Researchers reviewed the medical records of 3.5 million United States military veterans who had normal kidney function at the start of the analysis. Some had been given a diagnosis of constipation, and they ranked its severity by how often they used laxatives. The study followed the patients for an average of seven years. The scientists found 360,541 cases of chronic kidney disease and 7,677 cases of kidney failure over the course of the retrospective study. People with constipation had an average 13 percent higher risk of kidney disease and a 9 percent increased risk of kidney failure. The study, in The Journal of the American Society of Nephrology, also found that kidney function deteriorated faster in people with more severe constipation. “Chronic kidney disease affects more than 10 percent of the population,” said the senior author, Dr. Csaba P. Kovesdy, a professor of medicine at the University of Tennessee. “So this is an important public health issue.” The possible mechanism for the link is unknown. “Constipation may be an indication of changes in the microbiome,” the mix of microorganisms in the gut, Dr. Kovesdy said, “but we can’t prove any causal relationships.”
