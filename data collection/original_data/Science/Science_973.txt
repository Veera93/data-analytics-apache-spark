 Gunshots are the second leading cause of injury-related death in children, exceeded only by car accidents. In a typical week in the United States, 25 children die from bullet wounds. Between 2012 and 2014, an average of 1,297 children under age 18 died each year from firearm injuries. Aside from deaths in the course of law enforcement and other circumstances, there were an average of 693 homicides, 493 suicides and 82 unintentional deaths annually. In addition, there were 5,790 nonfatal injuries a year from gunshots, most due to assault. Researchers writing in the journal Pediatrics analyzed data gathered by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and by the National Electronic Injury Surveillance System. They found that the annual rate of firearm homicides among African-American children (3.5 per 100,000) was nearly 10 times the rate among whites. But the suicide rate among white children was almost four times the rate among blacks. The rate of unintentional firearm deaths among African-Americans was twice that of white children. There were wide geographical differences in firearm death rates. In eight states — Delaware, Hawaii, Maine, New Hampshire, North Dakota, Rhode Island, South Dakota and Vermont — there were fewer than 20 child firearm deaths a year from 2010 to 2014. The District of Columbia and Louisiana had the highest rates — 4.5 and 4.2 per 100,000 respectively. The highest gun homicide rates were in seven Southern states: Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, South Carolina and Tennessee. But rates were also high in Illinois, Missouri, Michigan, Ohio, Connecticut, Maryland, Pennsylvania, California and Nevada. Child suicides by gun were highest in Montana, Idaho, Oklahoma and Alaska. Most children who died of unintentional gun injuries were shot by another child of about the same age, most often while playing with a gun or showing it to others. Overall, child gun homicide rates declined 36 percent to 0.9 per 100,000 in 2014 from 1.4 in 2007. At the same time, suicides by gun increased 60 percent to 1.6 per 100,000 in 2014 from 1.0 in 2007. “There isn’t a single issue in isolation that increases the likelihood of gun death,” said the lead author, Katherine A. Fowler, a behavioral scientist with the C.D.C. “Children are at a higher risk of violence if they have academic problems, encouragements to be aggressive, and limited adult supervision,” she said. “The likelihood of violence is also higher in communities with high levels of instability, gang activity, drug sales, unemployment or poverty.”
