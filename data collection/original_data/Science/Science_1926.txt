 To the Editor: Re “In Reaction to Zika, Echoes of Polio” (Global Health, Aug. 30): My mother and I planned a summer trip in 1951; we were going to Mexico. We hoped to stop in Houston and reunite with relatives for a few days. That was not to be. We alit from our plane and were told that we could not leave the airport and were directed to change our tickets and board a PanAm clipper to Mexico City that very night. Houston was in quarantine because of an outbreak of polio. As a child, the fear of contracting polio was pervasive. During the summer, wet clothing after swimming was immediately removed. Even the slightest dip required changing to dry clothes. Anita J. Seyler, New York City Re “Relief for Menopausal Women” (Personal Health, Aug. 30): Thank you, Jane Brody for a concise review of the longstanding controversy surrounding postmenopausal hormone replacement therapy. I am a practicing OB/GYN in N.Y.C. and a member of NAMS (North American Menopause Society). I have been a proponent of H.R.T. for those women who are appropriate candidates. There are so many health and quality-of-life benefits afforded by H.R.T. Many women’s health practitioners like myself spend so much time explaining the findings of the W.H.I. study so that we effectively help our patients make informed decisions about H.R.T.
