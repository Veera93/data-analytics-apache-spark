 Q. How is ear wax produced and does it have a purpose? A. The yellow stuff in the outer part of the ear canal, scientifically named cerumen, is only partly a waxy substance, according to the National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders. The rest of the so-called wax is an accretion of some dust and lots of dead skin cells, which normally collect in the passage as they are shed. The waxy part, which holds the compacted waste together and smooths the way for it to leave the ear, comes from the ceruminous glands, which secrete lipids and other substances. They are specialized sweat glands just under the surface of the skin in the outer part of the canal. Besides lubricating the skin of the canal while keeping it dry, the lipids also help maintain a protective acidic coating, which helps kill bacteria and fungi that can cause infection and irritation. The normal working of muscles in the head, especially those that move the jaw, help guide the wax outward along the ear canal. The ceruminous glands commonly shrink in old age, producing less of the lipids and making it harder for waste to leave the ear. Excess wax buildup can usually be safely softened with warm olive or almond oil or irrigated with warm water, though specialized softening drops are also sold. Take care not to compress the buildup further with cotton swabs or other tools. If it cannot be safely removed, seek medical help. question@nytimes.com
