 Q. How hot does the water have to be to get germs out of domestic laundry? A. “It is hard to find standard guidelines on water temperatures for domestic laundry,” said Dr. Alexandra Sowa, an internist at NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital/Weill Cornell Medical Center. Even the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention provides only a vague recommendation: “Hot water washing is not necessary for all household laundry. Read and follow the clothing and soap or detergent label instructions. Wash and dry clothing in the warmest temperature listed on the clothing label.” But some studies suggest that water does not have to be as hot as often thought to get clothes acceptably clean, Dr. Sowa said. One study, done in Britain and published 12 years ago, showed that washing the very dirty clothes of hospital staff members at approximately 100 degrees Fahrenheit in a home washing machine was just as effective at killing one type of bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus) as washing it at a much higher temperature. Dr. Sowa pointed out that the study also found that washing the clothes resulted in contamination with new environmental bacteria, very likely from the washing machine itself. “To rid the clothes of any pathogens picked up in the wash cycle, the clothes just had to be tumble-dried for 30 minutes or ironed,” she said. “The heat from a low dry cycle or an iron was sufficient to get the clothes free of the studied bacteria.” Dr. Sowa recommended that washing machines be periodically cleansed of their considerable load of bacteria by running them for a regular cycle with bleach and water but without clothing. She said she would err on the side of caution when it came to washing certain items, like dish towels, the clothes of family members with infections and hospital scrubs, by using water heated to 140 degrees. question@nytimes.com
