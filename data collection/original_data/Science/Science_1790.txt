 BERLIN â€” Scientists here have flipped the switch on a mammoth detector designed to corner one the most elusive particles in the universe: the mysterious neutrino. Neutrinos are everywhere, one of the fundamental building blocks of the universe. But these particles carry no electrical charge and seem nearly massless, flying through matter as if they were apparitions. Trillions of ghost particles pass through your body every second. Scientists want to know how whether neutrinos have mass, and if so, exactly how much. The Karlsruhe Tritium Neutrino experiment began running tests Friday and will begin making measurements next year. (AP)
