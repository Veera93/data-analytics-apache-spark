 Q. Is one version of a vitamin or mineral supplement better than another? For example, what form of vitamin C is best absorbed? What about calcium? Are expensive vitamins more effective or safer? A. There is no simple answer to these questions. The National Institutes of Health has a separate body, the Office of Dietary Supplements, devoted to studying such issues and advising the public as well as health professionals, who are in the best position to advise consumers. Detailed fact sheets on individual vitamins and minerals give some idea of the issues involved. For example, for vitamin C, the office advises that a recent study found no difference in levels of vitamin C in the blood or in excretion among three different sources: simple ascorbic acid, a branded combination product and ascorbic acid combined with bioflavonoids. These results, combined with other studies and the low price of ascorbic acid, led the authors of the fact sheet to conclude that simple ascorbic acid is the preferred supplemental source. As for calcium, the office concluded that different forms were appropriate for different situations. Calcium carbonate is absorbed most efficiently with food, for instance, while calcium citrate is absorbed equally well with or without food. There are commercial laboratories that issue “seals of approval” for manufactured supplements. But the seals do not guarantee that the product is safe or effective, only that it is properly manufactured, contains the listed ingredients and does not have harmful levels of contaminants. question@nytimes.com
