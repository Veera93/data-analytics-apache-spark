 Q. I read somewhere that the gravitational force exerted by Jupiter is so great that it makes the sun move in its direction. Is this true? A. All the planets in the solar system interact gravitationally with the sun, but Jupiter’s great mass — nearly two and a half times that of the rest of the planets combined — makes this interaction visible to astronomers as a kind of dance rather than just a minuscule wobble. Any two objects in orbit around each other are actually in orbit around an invisible point called the center of mass, or barycenter. Jupiter is the only planet for which this barycenter is outside the radius of the sun. The traditional picture of the planets in an ordered parade around their star is much more complex. The perturbations resulting from gravitational interaction between planet and star are what have enabled astronomers to find planets outside our solar system. question@nytimes.com
