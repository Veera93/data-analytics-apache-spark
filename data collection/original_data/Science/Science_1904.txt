 To the Editor: Re “Healing the Lonely” (Sept. 6): I joined the ranks of the lonely when my husband died three years ago. I was 79, emotionally and physically depleted and almost completely deaf. I found that the internet and captioned TV helped me to feel less alone, but it was my hat in the ring to Match.com that brought me a partner and a farewell to loneliness. Admittedly, this isn’t for everyone, but I have given the matter extensive thought and believe that in our communities or neighborhoods, libraries and/or religious institutions could construct an outreach to connect the interested elderly with each other in a setting that would be safe and convenient. The elderly are a diverse group with a spectrum of skills including the know how and drive to create such an undertaking under appropriate sponsorship. Sandra S. Kaplan, Mount Lebanon, Pa.    As the article points out, while loneliness is certainly a big problem among the elderly, the numbers may pale in comparison to the number of youth and adults that suffer the same malady from social isolation — due to technology mediation via social media and simply “feeling” alone in a crowd as people “screen skate” though their days. My college students report that despite “being around others,” they often feel separate as more and more of their “friends” talk to screens instead of each other. It’s gotten so bad that the president of the student association is asking for university administration help to initiate support groups so young people can find “like-minded” souls searching for social connection. Loneliness is not just a problem for the aged, but a problem for us all in the age of digital everything. Humanity’s health overall, may also be at risk as a result.
