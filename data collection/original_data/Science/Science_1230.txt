 Despite their elusiveness, owls have always been objects of fascination. The ancient Romans believed the hoots of an owl warned of impending death. The Greeks viewed owls as symbols of wisdom and good fortune. Many African cultures continue to see them as portents of witchcraft, even as the West associates them with the magic of Harry Potter. “The Enigma of the Owl,” by Mike Unwin with photographs by David Tipling, explores the diversity, beauty and ecological importance of these nocturnal birds of prey. The book introduces readers to 53 of the world’s 200 to 250 species of owl, organizing the birds by continent and including well-known species as well as rare, more enigmatic ones. “When you see an owl, even if you have no interest in birds, you feel that you’ve seen something special, almost secret,” Mr. Unwin said. Most owls are creatures of the night, automatically putting them at odds to our own diurnal ways, Mr. Unwin said. At the same time, their faces are more human than almost any other bird, with large, forward-facing eyes triggering an urge to anthropomorphize, to see in them annoyance, enlightenment, indignation. In fact, the bird’s flattened facial disk, as it’s called, acts as a mini-satellite dish that amplifies sounds directly into the owl’s ears, which unlike those of most vertebrates, are asymmetrically positioned, allowing it to better pinpoint the scurry of favorite prey. “A great grey owl can sit on the top of a tree,” Mr. Unwin said, “then drop down and catch a lemming under a foot of snow.”
