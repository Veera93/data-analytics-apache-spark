 Q. What will happen to the salinity of the oceans as icebergs melt? A. While sea ice is frozen salt water, icebergs are pieces of glaciers, formed of compacted snowfall, and are therefore fresh water. Melting glaciers and icebergs release fresh water and reduce the salinity of the surrounding sea. The seawater also becomes less dense, changing patterns of ocean currents. The combination of factors, along with atmospheric changes, is partly why some oceans, including most of the North Atlantic, are becoming saltier despite increased glacial melting. Melting ice changes the ocean water chemistry in other ways, notably adding nutrients like iron and nitrates, which can feed the growth of phytoplankton, a key food for birds and fish. In conjunction with other processes, the added fresh water also increases acidity in the ocean, which can adversely affect sea life. The meltwater holds lower levels of carbonate minerals, the materials shellfish use to build their shells. question@nytimes.com
