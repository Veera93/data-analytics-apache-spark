 How much can an old, dried out piece of mold be worth? A lot, apparently, if it was once owned by the doctor who discovered penicillin. A patchy bit of mold from the laboratory of Dr. Alexander Fleming was auctioned in London last week for $14,617. The 90-year-old sample is preserved in a round glass case and features an inscription by Fleming on the back, describing it as “the mould that first made penicillin.” That may be a stretch. Historians say the Scottish-born doctor likely made dozens of such mementos for such luminaries as Winston Churchill and Marlene Dietrich.
