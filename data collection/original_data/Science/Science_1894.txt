 Indigo and cotton made a fine pair long before bluejeans ever existed. A new study, published this week in Science Advances, reports the earliest known use of indigo dye to date, found in 6,000-year-old cotton textiles from Peru. Before these findings, archaeologists attributed the earliest use of indigo to ancient Egypt, where indigo-dyed linens have been found wrapped around mummies from about 4,400 years ago. In the new study, researchers found traces of blue pigment woven into fabrics from an ancient temple on the north coast of Peru. The dry weather there and the hard, concrete-like material of the temple, located in a prehistoric settlement called Huaca Prieta, preserved the fabrics exceptionally well, said Jeffrey Splitstoser, an assistant research professor of anthropology at George Washington University and an author of the paper. He studied hundreds of textile samples that were found alongside gourds, baskets and mats in the temple. Microscopically examining the fabrics, he found that most had been altered in some way. Often it seemed they had been cut or torn and then had liquid poured over them. Dr. Splitstoser says he thinks the people of Huaca Prieta possibly used the textiles to wrap up offerings to the gods. In addition, Dr. Splitstoser suspects that the fabrics may have been part of an early communication system, which used features like colors and weaving patterns in textiles to encode information. Along with indigo blue, the textiles from Huaca Prieta also featured red, gold, white and tan stripes.
