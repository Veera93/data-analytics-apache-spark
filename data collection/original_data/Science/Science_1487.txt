 The rate of abortions performed in the United States has fallen lower than during any year since 1973, when the Supreme Court legalized the procedure, according to a new report by the Guttmacher Institute, a research group that supports abortion rights. The latest numbers, for 2014, continue a trend of declining abortion rates for most years since 1981. In 2014, there were an estimated 926,200 abortions — a rate of 14.6 per 1,000 women of childbearing age (15 to 44) — compared with 1.06 million abortions in 2011, the year of the last Guttmacher report, or 16.9 per 1,000. In 1973, the year of the Roe v. Wade decision, the rate was 16.3. In 1981, the rate was 29.3. Researchers suggested that increased use of long-term birth control, such as intrauterine devices and contraceptive implants, contributed to the most recent decline. In particular, the proportion of clients at federally funded family planning clinics who sought such methods increased to 11 percent in 2014 from 7 percent in 2011. Because women who rely on these clinics are disproportionately young and poor and account for a majority of unintended pregnancies, researchers said, even a moderate increase in reliance on these methods could have an effect on the abortion rate. The impact of restrictive anti-abortion laws and the shuttering of clinics on abortion rates was unclear. For example, the abortion rate rose modestly in six states: Kansas, Arkansas, Michigan, Mississippi, North Carolina and Vermont. Yet between 2001 and 2014, with the exception of Vermont, all of these states introduced more restrictive abortion laws. “The underlying purpose of these restrictions was to reduce access to abortion, but clearly that doesn’t always happen,” said Rachel K. Jones, a principal research scientist at Guttmacher and the lead author of the report. Nationally, there was a 6 percent decline in the number of clinics performing abortions. In the Midwest, the percentage of closing clinics was 22 percent; in the South, 13 percent. By contrast, the percentage of clinics in the Northeast increased 14 percent. “But an increased number of clinics doesn’t mean you’re going to have more abortions,” said Ms. Jones. In New Jersey, the number of clinics rose to 41 in 2014 from 24 in 2011. Yet the number of abortions in the state during that period declined, to about 44,000 in 2014 from about 47,000 in 2011. For the first time, researchers asked about the incidence of self-induced abortion: 12 percent of clinics reported having treated at least one patient who had tried to end her own pregnancy.
