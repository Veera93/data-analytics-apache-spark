 Q. What gives rise to the distinctive odor I detect from sycamore trees? A. The American sycamore, Platanus occidentalis, with its distinctive peeling bark, is not well known for its scent, but there are many anecdotal reports from people who find it emits a sweet odor. The sycamore is also called the buttonwood tree or American planetree. Perhaps youâ€™re thinking of an unrelated old-world tree, Ficus sycomorus, or sycamore fig, which is far better known to perfume makers. Chanel once used an extract of its leaves in its famous fragrance. In both trees, and in many other odoriferous species, the chemical source of the scent may be the same. Their leaves, bark and sometimes wood are rich in organic chemicals called terpenes and terpenoids, volatile oils that are a major component of the essential oils used in perfumes. These oils are commonly extracted by crushing the plant material and putting it in a petroleum-based solvent. The sycamore fig leaves behind a waxy substance that is called fig leaf extract. It is then further extracted using an alcohol, which evaporates, leaving a purified form called fig leaf absolute. That form can be dissolved and diluted once more in alcohol to become perfume. question@scitimes.com
