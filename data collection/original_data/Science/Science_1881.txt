 Arctic sea ice this summer shrank to its second-lowest level since scientists began satellite monitoring, another ominous signal of global warming. The sea ice reached its summer low point on Saturday, extending 1.6 million square miles â€” just behind the mark set in 2012, 1.31 million square miles. One researcher speculated that the Arctic may be ice free in summertime by 2030. The overall declines in sea ice, other scientists suggest, may affect the jet stream and influence weather farther south.
