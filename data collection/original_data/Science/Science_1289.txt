 Q. Why were prehistoric animals so big? Or is the real question why are their descendants so much smaller? A. Many possible explanations have been suggested for different species, from higher oxygen levels in the very ancient atmosphere to more modern human predation, but a general answer lies in the workings of natural selection. “Body size is one of the obvious things that natural selection works on,” said Ross MacPhee, a curator in the department of mammalogy at the American Museum of Natural History. Depending on the group, he said, large sizes come and go as evolutionary opportunities arise. For example, because of their physiological adaptations, large animals can extract nutrients from foods like grasses that the guts of small animals simply cannot adequately digest, Dr. MacPhee said. Thus, the existence of extensive grasslands would favor some larger species. In mammals, like elephants, large size correlates with certain life-history traits like long life spans, long gestation periods and relatively few offspring per female, Dr. MacPhee said. Small size, as in shrews or mice, correlates with shorter life spans but fast gestation and large numbers of offspring. Each size extreme would thrive better in certain environmental conditions. Because of recent extinctions, there are certainly fewer large, or megafaunal, species alive today, Dr. MacPhee said. “In North America, we are down to about a dozen megafaunal mammal species, defined as those having body sizes of 100 pounds or more,” he said. “Twelve thousand years ago, we had roughly three times as many, including the iconic mammoths, giant sloths, saber-tooth cats, horses, camels, giant rodents, short-faced bears and many others.” question@nytimes.com
