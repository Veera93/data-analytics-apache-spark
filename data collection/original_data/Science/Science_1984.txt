 Early human history was written with stone tools. James Pokines, a forensic anthropologist at the Boston University School of Medicine, and his colleagues uncovered several 250,000-year-old blades and hand axes, with bits of rhinoceros, horse and camel on them, in Jordan. “We know they were butchering them or processing the carcass,” Dr. Pokines said. “But is it proof that they killed all of the species here? Probably not. They could have scavenged them all, but we don’t know.” The findings, which were published in The Journal of Archaeological Science, may be the oldest evidence of protein residue on stone tools.
