 The cabinets and shelves of the National Wildlife Property Repository, just northeast of Denver, are crammed with stuffed monkeys and ivory carvings, snow leopard coats and dried seal penises, chairs with tails and lamps with hooves. Most of them are contraband, seized at airports in New York City, Los Angeles and other major ports of entry; some are donated by people who have no use for them. The photographer Tristan Spinski recently visited the repository, producing images that testify to the human appetite for other species. RACHEL NUWER
