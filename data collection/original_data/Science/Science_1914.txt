 Here’s a prehistoric case of the blind leading the blind. Some 365 million years ago, eyeless trilobites marched across the seafloor in single file. Their archaic conga lines may be some of the earliest examples of animal mass migration, according to a study published in the September issue of Paleontology. “These ancient arthropods may have migrated periodically to shallow marine areas for mass mating and spawning,” Blazej Blazejowski, a paleobiologist from the Polish Academy of Sciences and lead author of the study, said in an email. Dr. Blazejowski and his colleagues found a fossil in a quarry in central Poland. They examined it along with nearly 80 other trilobite chains, the longest of which contained more than 19 individuals. Because the creatures were blind, they most likely relied on chemical cues to queue. This process, called chemotaxis, is seen in present day crustaceans like spiny lobsters, which also line up in an antennae-to-tail procession as they migrate. The researchers aren’t exactly sure what suddenly derailed the trilobite caravans, but they think that toxic amounts of carbon dioxide and hydrogen sulfide may have mixed into the ocean bottom and killed them literally in their tracks. As time went on they became buried in the sediment, which forever fossilized their game of “follow-the-leader.”
