 You’ve heard of the Jaws of Life. How about the mandibles of power? In the world of a male stag beetle, a good spot on a rotting log is a way to attract females, who like rotting wood to lay their eggs in. But to keep their spots, the males must fend off challengers. The weapon of choice: giant, fearsome mandibles. Jana Goyens and her colleagues at the University of Antwerp in Belgium have been studying stag beetle behavior and the anatomy that makes it possible. Dr. Goyens is a specialist in biomechanics — how the bodies of animals work, in terms of physics — and she came to stag beetles because the species that like to fight are so physically extreme. “I completely love them,” she said. “They completely invest in fighting.” The evolutionary result is jaws so big that their weight alone makes running and flying much more difficult. While fighting, a beetle with a long reach tries to bite his opponent’s legs to loosen his grip on a log. Or he just clamps down on an opponent’s body and lifts him into the air like a professional wrestler about to do a body slam. It might seem that it would be hard to maintain a strong bite with extremely long mandibles, and that they might be more fragile because of their length. But Dr. Goyens and her colleagues Joris Dirckx and Peter Aerts report that the most aggressive species, which have the longest jaws, also have the strongest bites — up to 28 times as strong as the weakest species. The bites of the big-jawed beetles grow stronger because of muscle development and the points at which muscles are attached. T he material of which they are composed is thicker and has evolved a shape more resistant to crushing forces. There’s a lot of evolutionary pressure for big jaws, it would seem. When two males fight, it’s usually the beetle with the bigger jaws that wins.
