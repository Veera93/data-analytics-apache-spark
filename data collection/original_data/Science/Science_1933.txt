 Behold, the very first close-up of Jupiter’s big blue north pole. NASA released several images taken by its Juno spacecraft during its initial orbit around the largest planet in our solar system. For NASA’s astronomers, the images reveal a hardly recognizable picture of the gas giant known for its Great Red Spot. “It’s bluer in color up there than other parts of the planet, and there are a lot of storms,” Scott Bolton, the principal investigator for Juno, said in a statement. “It looks like nothing we have seen or imagined before.” During this first orbital flyby, Juno came within about 2,500 miles of the planet and also passed over its southern pole. There, it took images of Jupiter’s brilliant southern aurora. Juno plans to complete 35 more orbital flybys over the course of its 20-month mission, according to NASA.
