 For the first time since last fall, officials in Texas have reported what they believe is a case of mosquito transmission of the Zika virus within the state’s borders. If correct, it would be the first known instance of local mosquito transmission within the continental United States this year. The single case, reported in Hidalgo County, on the Mexican border, “was probably transmitted by a mosquito bite in South Texas sometime in the last few months,” the state’s health department said on Wednesday. The affected person, who was not identified, is no longer capable of transmitting the disease, officials said. The Zika virus usually disappears from the blood of recovering victims within two weeks, after which it can no longer be transferred by mosquitoes. In some cases, the Zika virus can linger in sperm for months. The sex of the victim was not given, but most Zika testing focuses on pregnant women; the disease is usually mild in adults, but can be fatal to a growing fetus. Officials believe the Hidalgo County resident picked up the virus locally because the person had not traveled recently to any areas with local Zika transmission and had no other risk factors, such as sex with a man who had the virus. Local officials said they have increased mosquito-control efforts and have asked doctors in the area to be on the lookout for more cases. In late June, the Pan American Health Organization reported continuing local transmission of Zika in most of Mexico, including counties along the Texas border. But transmission was highest in southern Mexico, and the country’s overall case numbers were down by more than 90 percent from their peak in October. Hidalgo County, whose largest city is McAllen, is inland and up the Rio Grande from coastal Cameron County, where the virus circulated briefly in mosquitoes last year in an outbreak much smaller than the better-known one in Miami.
