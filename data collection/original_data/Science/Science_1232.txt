 Scientists reviewing video from camera traps watched dumbfounded as a 16-pound badger worked four days to bury a 50-pound calf carcass. Badgers, carnivores native to the American West, are generally nocturnal and spend most of their time in burrows. They are known to cache food to eat later — squirrels and rabbits, typically. No one has ever seen a badger put away such a large hunk of meat. The scientists had put out seven calf carcasses in an attempt to study scavenging behavior. At one site, the carcass had completely disappeared. A look at video from the camera trap was enough to see what had happened. After burying the carcass, the badger built a den next to his large food supply. No other badger visited the site. “It’s a substantial undertaking,” said Ethan H. Frehner, an associate instructor in biology at the University of Utah.
