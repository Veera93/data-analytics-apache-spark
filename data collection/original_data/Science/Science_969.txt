 Teen vaping declined drastically last year in the United States after years of sharp increases. The number of high school and middle school students using electronic cigarettes fell to 2.2 million in 2016 from 3 million in 2015, according to a survey released last week by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. It is the first decline in teen vaping since the agency began tracking in 2011. A University of Michigan survey also reported a decline in 2016. (A.P.)
