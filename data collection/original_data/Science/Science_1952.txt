 NASA has re-established contact with an errant spacecraft. In October 2006, the space agency sent twin satellites into orbit to study the Sun. The satellites follow Earth’s orbit around the sun, one ahead of us and one behind: STEREO-A and STEREO-B. The devices were expected to last two years, but they lasted longer. Scientists realized there would come a time when they would each be in a position where the sun would interfere with their transmissions for almost four months. During this time, the spacecraft would reset every 72 hours — a hard-wired function that could not be changed. So in October 2014, as a test, NASA turned each one off and then back on again three days later. All went well with STEREO-A. But when STEREO-B was turned back on, the signal was lost. Finally, after much effort, the wandering twin was heard from last week. It turned out that a gyroscope problem had started a chain of events that prevented solar panels from recharging the batteries. “We only know how fast it’s spinning, roughly in which direction it’s pointing, and that the battery is at least partially charged,” said Joseph B. Gurman, a project scientist at NASA. But at least STEREO-B is back in touch.
