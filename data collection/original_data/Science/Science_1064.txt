 A warmer, wetter climate may be pushing tree species into new ranges on the East Coast. The Eastern white pine is going west, while the Eastern cottonwood is headed north, researchers reported last week. The scarlet oak is appearing more frequently in regions northwest of the Appalachians and less often in the Southeast, which is becoming drier. A northward shift was expected, the researchers said, but the fact that many species are moving west came as a surprise. The westward movement helped point to climate change — especially wetter weather — as the biggest of many culprits behind the shift. But given the rapid rates of change, harvesting, forest fires and other disturbances are also playing significant roles, other experts noted. (A.P.)
