 HBO has signed Ronan Farrow to a three-year deal to develop and become the face of a new investigative series, the network announced on Thursday. The deal is set to begin later this year. Mr. Farrow’s reporting in The New Yorker on Harvey Weinstein has helped spur a national discussion on sexual harassment and misconduct in the workplace. His first Weinstein story was published in October, boosting his profile and making him something of a hot property in TV news circles, even though his last stint as a television journalist did not have a happy ending. A former NBC News correspondent, Mr. Farrow began work on his Weinstein story there but was told to stop reporting the story for the network over the summer. Mr. Farrow continued anyway, and then published the first article just over two months later with The New Yorker, after his contract with NBC expired. Mr. Farrow suggested that NBC had sought to kill the story, and said the exposé should have been made “public earlier.” NBC countered that the reporting had not been ready to be made public. In a statement on Thursday, Mr. Farrow said, “Over the course of my television and print investigations in recent years, it’s become clear to me that there’s a new generation of viewers seeking out serious, substantive reporting that takes on powerful interests and attacks systemic unfairness that too often is swept under the rug.” In a statement, HBO’s programming president, Casey Bloys, said of Mr. Farrow, “His work has contributed to this watershed moment in our culture, and we are excited to provide a platform for this dogged reporter to pursue projects that continue to speak truth to power.” Mr. Farrow has also signed on as a contributing writer for The New Yorker, HBO said.
