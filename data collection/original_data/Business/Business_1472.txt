 Q. I have my account set up in the Mail app, but how do I find my Gmail contacts list on my iPad? A. If you cannot find the address book you use with your Gmail on the web, it may be because your Gmail contacts are not set to sync with your iPad. Once you configure the settings, you should see your Gmail connections listed when you open the iPad’s standard Contacts app. To sync Gmail contacts to an iOS device running iOS 11, go to the iPad’s home screen and tap open the Settings icon. Select Accounts &amp; Passwords. On the next screen, under Accounts, tap Gmail, Google or whatever you nicknamed the mail account when you first set it up on the iPad. On the Gmail settings screen, go to the Contacts line and tap the button to the On position. In addition to mail and contacts, you can sync your Google Calendar and Notes to your iPad; the information then appears in the iPad’s default Calendar and Notes apps. Press the Home button when you are finished. Because the contacts list is now set to synchronize, changes you make — like updating an address or phone number for someone on your list — should update across all your devices. For those using Android devices, Google Contacts are added automatically when you first set up your Google Account on the new phone or tablet. The address book also stays in sync when you make changes to contacts cards on the computer or mobile device.
