 Q. How can I retrieve a still photo from the 1.5 seconds of an iPhone Live Photo before or after the official picture? A. Live Photos — Apple’s format that captures a bit of the subject’s movement right before and after the “official” picture — can be edited. In addition to adjusting the light, color and contrast of the shot, you can select a new “key photo,” which is the image you see in your picture library. Open the Photos app on the iPhone and find the image you want to edit; Live Photos are also collected in their own Live Photos album on the app’s Albums tab. After you open the file, tap the Edit button in the upper-right corner of the screen. The picture opens in the Edit mode, where the familiar tools for cropping and enhancing the photo are available. On a Live Photo in Edit mode, a strip of tiny thumbnail images also appears at the bottom of the screen. These images are the individual frames of the Live Photo, and you can scroll across until you find the right picture. When you see the frame you want to use displayed in the center of the screen, tap the Make Key Photo button, then tap the Done button. After making that change, you should see the new still in your camera library. Live Photos do not work with many non-Apple apps, so sharing the picture with others online or with other devices means the image you edited will be the one seen by your friends. Tapping off the Live Photos button on an image also turns it into a still photo. Apple’s own tools for editing Live Photos are included in its iOS 11 software, but for those using earlier versions of iOS, third-party apps like Motion Stills are an alternative.
