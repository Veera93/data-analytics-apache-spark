 Nelson Peltz got his board seat after all. The activist investor will join the Procter &amp; Gamble board on March 1 after the one of the largest, priciest and nastiest corporate proxy fights in history, the company said Friday night. And the appointment looks like it will stick: Procter &amp; Gamble, which owns brands such as Tide and Gillette, said it would renominate Mr. Peltz to the board at next year’s annual meeting in October. Mr. Peltz’s board appointment was hard-won. He started his bid for the seat in July, saying that the company needed to cut costs and scale back its management bureaucracy. Mr. Peltz’s investment firm, Trian Fund Management, estimated that Procter &amp; Gamble spent more than $100 million defending itself against the campaign. After the election at Procter &amp; Gamble’s most recent annual meeting, in October, both sides declared victory. Mr. Peltz said he had won by a narrow margin, citing an independent vote count. But Procter &amp; Gamble demurred, saying it needed to look into the results. The final tally showed that Mr. Peltz fell just short of a majority, said Damon Jones, a spokesman for Procter &amp; Gamble. “But because it was so close, we decided to appoint Nelson Peltz to the board,” he said. Mr. Peltz is also the nonexecutive chairman of Wendy’s, the fast-food company, and sits on the boards of Mondelez International, Sysco and the Madison Square Garden Company. “We respect Nelson Peltz as a highly engaged share owner and investor, and look forward to his contributions as a member of P.&amp;G.’s Board,” David S. Taylor, the chief executive and chairman of Procter &amp; Gamble, said in a statement.
