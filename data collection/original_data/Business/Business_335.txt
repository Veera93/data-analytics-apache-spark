On Wall Street, there’s been a running parlor game about whether Jamie Dimon, JPMorgan Chase’s chief executive, would try to run for president in 2020. His annual letters, filled with commentary on U.S. policy, have only increased the chatter, and this year’s letter, released Thursday, is no different. It touches on everything from trade to immigration. While Mr. Dimon, who once called himself “barely a Democrat,” says he plans to stay at the bank for the next five years, the question among political prognosticators is whether Mr. Dimon’s policy views could ever find a home among voters in this politically polarized environment. Mr. Dimon’s sensible letter was seemingly supportive of some of President Trump’s policies, while taking the opposing side on others. Mr. Dimon particularly applauded the corporate tax cut and deregulation efforts. On China trade, Mr. Dimon writes: “It is not unreasonable for the United States to press ahead for more equivalency,” and that “one of the administration’s best arguments is that negotiation alone has not worked.” However, he said he would like to see more cooperation with U.S. allies on talks with China and added that the U.S. should “revisit the Trans-Pacific Partnership.” On immigration, he called for tougher border control, writing, “American citizens have the right to complain that we have not successfully protected our borders since the last immigration reform in 1986.” He also said, “People immigrating to this country should be taught American history, our language and our principles.” At the same time, he also advocated for “a path to legal status and citizenship” for “Dreamers” and improving “merit-based immigration” programs so that immigrants educated here can stay. Mr. Dimon made a point of saying that part of the problems facing the country is that too many people are talking past each other. “When people argue as if there are binary solutions, the argument is almost always wrong,” he wrote, advocating that people try to look at all sides of a situation. “I tell my liberal friends to read columnists like Arthur Brooks and George Will. And I tell my conservative friends to read writers like Tom Friedman.” If Mr. Dimon were to run, he would likely have to do so as an independent. It is hard to see how liberal Democrats would embrace much of his deregulatory positions. And yet many of his positions – and especially some of his social positions not enunciated in his letter — may not be far right enough to capture the interest of Republicans. Maybe the country needs someone in the middle, but history has not been kind to third-party candidates. — Andrew Ross Sorkin Jamie Dimon, in his annual letter to JPMorgan Chase’s shareholders, had much to say about political issues like trade and immigration. But he also addressed a policy area much closer to home – bank regulation. Mr. Dimon often has expressed skepticism about aspects of the banking overhaul that took place in the wake of the financial crisis. But his remarks on regulation arguably carry more weight now. Congress is closer to modifying the post-crisis rules than at any point since Dodd-Frank was signed into law in 2010. An important regulatory requirement Mr. Dimon criticized, therefore, might become a focus for those wanting to roll back the rules. Mr. Dimon in this year’s letter zeroed in on regulations that require banks to have a certain amount of liquidity, the financial term for access to cash or low-risk assets that can be easily sold for cash. In 2008, some large financial firms were crippled when customers, depositors and creditors withdrew their money. The Federal Reserve and taxpayers had to step in to support the banks. To help prevent a repeat of this, post-crisis rules require that banks hold a certain amount of liquid assets to cover a theoretical level of outflows. Mr. Dimon is in favor of banks having more liquidity than before the crisis, but in the letter, released Thursday, he wrote: Notably, legislation currently in Congress would tweak liquidity rules. If it passes, bankers may press for more loosening. And, as they have before, bank lobbyists may deploy Mr. Dimon’s main argument here – that regulation can lead to less lending. But there are flaws in this line of attack, especially when it comes to liquidity rules. First, a bank that lacks liquidity is in no position to lend. When a bank’s creditors and customers fear it doesn’t have enough cash in reserve, they will most likely withdraw their money. This not only deprives the bank of the money it needs to lend, it also sharply reduces its chance of survival. Or as Gregg Gelzinis of the left-leaning Center for American Progress puts it, “You won’t be able to take this action if you fail.” Perhaps more importantly, Mr. Dimon leaves out some crucial context. Congress designed the whole post-crisis overhaul to ensure that banks have the funds on hand to lend during a downturn. Dodd-Frank’s architects saw that when banks stop lending, it makes a recession far worse. And that is one reason why banks now have much higher levels of capital. Regulators expect that they will use up some of that capital to keep lending through the economic tumult. This is why the Federal Reserve said after its last bank stress tests: Andrew Gray, a JPMorgan spokesman, followed up with more material on Mr. Dimon’s thinking on liquidity. He re-emphasized Mr. Dimon’s point about having to tie up funds that could be used to make loans. Mr. Gray noted that a bank facing outflows would be expected to keep refilling its pool of liquid assets to be in compliance with a liquidity regulation. This would leave fewer funds for lending and making markets, Mr. Gray asserted. He also addressed the argument that higher capital levels, not liquidity, will largely determine the extent to which banks will lend through a downturn. Mr. Gray asserted that liquidity rules play an important role in ensuring banks have the resources to participate in wider financial markets. Rules forcing the hoarding of liquidity may, thus, crimp that activity. — Peter Eavis Mick Mulvaney, the acting director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, has complained that the regulator engages in “wasteful spending.” He even submitted a quarterly budget request recently of $0. That attitude apparently didn’t apply to two of his recent hires. Mr. Mulvaney appointed two senior staff members who are paid salaries far above what they had been earning in their previous government jobs in Washington, according to agency documents obtained by The New York Times through a public records request. • Kirsten Sutton was hired in January to be the agency’s chief of staff. Mr. Mulvaney agreed to pay her $259,500 a year. Her salary is the highest allowed under the consumer bureau’s pay scale and represents a raise of more than 50 percent working for one of the C.F.P.B.’s fiercest critics, Representative Jeb Hensarling of Texas, the Republican chairman of the House Financial Services Committee. It is also 22 percent more than her predecessor. • Brian Johnson is another new deputy. In late December, Mr. Mulvaney signed paperwork that awarded Mr. Johnson a salary of $239,595. Mr. Johnson previously worked on the House Financial Services Committee. In his most recent job there, as policy director, he earned about $170,000 a year, according to LegiStorm. Of the 20 people at the bureau with the title of senior adviser, Mr. Johnson is the second-highest paid. (Another adviser, whose name wasn’t disclosed in the public records reviewed by The Times, is paid $240,000.) Context The consumer bureau, as well as fellow financial regulators like the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, is allowed under federal law to pay employees significantly more than other government agencies can pay. The rationale is that the higher salaries are necessary to recruit skilled employees who otherwise might land jobs on Wall Street. As a result, the C.F.P.B. is stocked with employees who earn more than the average Washington bureaucrat. Of the agency’s 1,600 employees, 219 make more than $200,000, according to the records reviewed by The Times. — Stacy Cowley BlackRock, the world’s largest money manager, plans to offer a series of new products allowing individuals and institutions to invest in market indexes without putting money into manufacturers and retailers of firearms. They include: • a new exchange-traded fund that will track the performance of the MSCI USA Small Cap Extended ESG Focus Index, composed of small stocks with favorable environmental, social and governance standards, while specifically excluding producers and large retailers of civilian firearms. • a similar credit-focused ETF that eschews the debt of gunmakers and distributors. • an option to take the guns out of institutional strategies tracking major market indexes, including the S&amp;P 500, the Russell 2000 and three others. Critic’s corner Rob Cox of Breakigviews writes: What emerged from Facebook yesterday — in Mark Zuckerberg’s conference call with reporters and in a company blog post — were revelations that users’ public data was more compromised than previously thought. • Facebook said Cambridge Analytica harvested the data of 87 million users, not 50 million. • A vulnerability in search and account recovery functions may have exposed “most” of Facebook’s 2 billion users to unauthorized harvesting of their public profile information. Mr. Zuckerberg, ahead of his testimony to Congress, struck a conciliatory tone. But regulators in Australia, the U.S. and elsewhere are investigating whether the company broke privacy rules. Facebook also outlined steps to prevent misuse of its platform. Among the most significant: restriction of access to so-called A.P.I.s that let developers plug into its network. The Verge’s take: “Effectively, Facebook has put a nail in the coffin of its app platform.” The most immediate effect: Tinder users couldn’t log in. A brighter note for Facebook: Its shares are up in premarket trading today, after Mr. Zuckerberg said that #DeleteFacebook didn’t appear to be having much effect. The Facebook calendar • April 9: Alerts should start popping up for users whose information may have been shared with Cambridge Analytica. • April 10: Mr. Zuckerberg is scheduled to testify before the Senate’s Commerce and Judiciary committees. • April 11: He will testify before the House Energy and Commerce Committee.

President Trump and the White House insist that the U.S. isn’t in a trade war with China. But it hasn’t backed off from its tariff threats, and the White House press secretary, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, said the U.S. may feel “a little bit of short-term pain.” More from behind the scenes, by Ana Swanson and Keith Bradsher of the NYT: Calming the markets has mostly fallen to Larry Kudlow, the White House’s national economic adviser of less than a week. Peter Eavis’s take: We can take lessons on the U.S.-China trade skirmish from Brexit. Looking back, the panicky early reaction to that seems to have sprung more from a fear of the unknown than any big threats to the global trading system. And Greg Ip of the WSJ, who says China started the trade fight, had an informative tweetstorm about each side’s vulnerabilities: But Neil Irwin of the Upshot warns that China has other ways of retaliating. The United States trade deficit rose 1.6 percent to $57.6 billion, its highest level since October 2008. The deficit has now risen for six straight months, the longest such streak since 2000. The merchandise-trade gap with China narrowed to $34.7 billion in February from $35.5 billion. The Trump administration wants to cut $100 billion, or about 25 percent, from the annual deficit with China, Bloomberg points out. During President Trump’s first year in office, the United States’ trade deficit with China rose to $375.2 billion in 2017, a record high. Last May, Blackstone announced with great fanfare that it planned a $40 billion fund with Saudi Arabia to invest in U.S. infrastructure: up to $20 billion from the Saudis, who would match commitments by other outside partners. But as of now, Blackstone has secured just $575 million in such commitments — and missed two fund-raising deadlines. What’s happened, per Kate Kelly and Andrew: • The Saudis wanted the fund overseen by an investment committee, with a seat for them. Blackstone refused. • Many potential investors balked at committing money until an investment team was in place, a process that took some time. In other infrastructure news: D.J. Gribbin, the Trump administration’s infrastructure point person, is leaving the White House, which looks to have delayed its investment plan until after the midterms. • The E.P.A. chief Scott Pruitt, the subject of some unhappy rumblings from the White House, has begun a media pushback against claims about his spending.

(Bloomberg) The woman suspected of shooting three people at YouTube headquarters before killing herself had become angry with the company’s policies. Police did not say which ones, but she had posted about YouTube pulling ads from videos that it said did not meet its standards. The woman, Nasim Najafi Aghdam, was a social media video star in Iran and had called YouTube a dictatorship because she was making less money from her posts. Also of note: The attack highlighted the tension between Silicon Valley giants’ love of big, open campuses and their security needs. As the two corporate siblings jostle over a potential union — Viacom has reportedly rejected CBS's offer and is preparing a counter bid — who would run the combined company remains a sticking point. Rich Greenfield of BTIG offered a contrarian case against it being Mr. Moonves of CBS, one of the best-regarded media executives around. “The future of a combined Viacom and CBS is going to be driven by an increasing focus on international and scaling up,” he wrote — an agenda better suited to Viacom’s C.E.O., Bob Bakish. • Investor withdrawals at Bill Ackman’s Pershing Square Capital Management are huge.
