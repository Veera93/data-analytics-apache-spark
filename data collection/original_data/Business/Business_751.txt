 Q. Do I have control over my iPhone’s autocorrect function beyond repeatedly correcting words it mistakenly tries to use?  A. The iOS keyboard’s auto-correction feature, intended to be a timesaver and an aid for typing on small glass keyboards, checks spelling and automatically fixes mistakes as you enter text. Good intentions aside, the software has been known to insert incorrect words in the process, which has led to embarrassing mistakes and a few websites devoted to collecting the gaffes. However, you do not have to constantly correct the auto-correction tool. If you find the auto-correction feature consistently tries to change the same words that you type to the same wrong words, the keyboard’s dictionary file may have saved incorrect entries. If you do not have a lot of custom words you have saved and want to start over so the auto-correction tool learns new words from scratch, you can dump the old dictionary. To do that, open the Settings app on the home screen, select General and scroll to the bottom of the list. Select Reset and then Reset Keyboard Dictionary, enter your passcode if asked and delete the old dictionary. If you do not want to ditch the dictionary, you can turn off the auto-correction tool and make other adjustments in the iOS keyboard settings. Tap the Settings icon on the iPhone’s Home screen and choose General. Scroll down the screen until you get to Keyboard and select it. You can disable auto-correction entirely but leave the spellchecker on to highlight suspect words. The controls for automatic capitalization and a few other typing aids are also here, as is the setting for the predictive text bar on the keyboard that suggest words as you type. If you have a tendency to repeat typos in certain words or want to expand abbreviations into full phrases, tap Text Replacement to set up automatic conversions as you type.
