 Stocks on Wall Street closed mixed on Wednesday, a day after President Trump’s top economic adviser, Gary D. Cohn, said he would resign amid an internal White House dispute over the decision to impose stiff tariffs on imported steel and aluminum. • The Standard &amp; Poor’s 500-stock index recovered much of its opening-bell losses, ending the day slightly lower, by less than a tenth of a percent. The Dow Jones industrial average closed lower by a third of a percent, while the Nasdaq composite ended in positive territory, gaining a third of a percent. • Earlier in the day, Asian markets closed lower, while European markets ended the session higher. The yield on a 10-year Treasury note was little changed. The global declines came as the plans to impose tariffs drew condemnation and threats of retaliation from major American trading partners, including Canada, China and the European Union. The announcement by Mr. Cohn that he would leave the administration amplified those fears. Mr. Cohn had argued against imposing tariffs. Stock markets had made gains in recent days, but Deutsche Bank analysts said in a note to clients that those moves were largely to do with a belief that the president’s advisers, like Mr. Cohn, and fellow Republican Party leaders would rein in the proposals. “That optimism is fading this morning,” the analysts said. They added that Mr. Cohn’s resignation suggests “that Trump is leaning heavily towards some form of protectionist measures. Needless to say that Cohn’s resignation also leaves further question marks around Trump’s economic agenda.”
