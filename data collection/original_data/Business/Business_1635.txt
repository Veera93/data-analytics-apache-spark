 Q. The cards in the Google app on my Android phone show me recipes, but I recently became a vegetarian and many of the suggested dishes include meat. How can I get meatless suggestions? A. The personalized information cards displayed in the Google app show you things based on your stated interests or past search history, but you can update your dietary preferences in the app’s settings. Start by opening the Google app. In the Android version of the Google app, tap the Menu icon in the upper-left corner of the screen and choose Customize from the menu. Scroll down to the More Preferences section and select Cooking. On the Cooking preferences screen, you can turn the recipe recommendations on or off — and you can also choose to see only vegetarian, vegan or pork-free recipes displayed in your feed. Tap the Done button in the upper-right corner when you have made your adjustments. Google has been highlighting recipes in search results for years, but some users first began to notice a regular “Culinary Inspiration” card offering recipes in the Google app feed earlier this year. The recipe cards, likely catered to those who have searched for cooking information, recipes or food before on Google, were spotted not long after the company announced it was rolling out a more visual way to display results from recipe searches. Last April, Google also introduced a recipe audio narration by its Google Assistant software running on the Google Home speaker. The Google app is also available for those using iOS devices, although the customization controls are not as specific. To make adjustments to your feed, tap your profile photo in the upper-left corner of the screen and on the Setting screen, tap Feed.
