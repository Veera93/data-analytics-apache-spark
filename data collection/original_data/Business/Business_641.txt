 Q. The top menu bar of my Mac has become cluttered with these little icons that I rarely use and are more distracting than anything. Is there a way to turn them off? A. Most of the icons clustered on the right side of the Mac’s menu bar — “status icons,” as Apple calls them — can be removed, rearranged or restored according to your personal preferences. The icons are meant to provide quick access to controls like the Mac’s network, Bluetooth and AirPlay settings, and third-part apps may also add their own mini-menus up there. Spotlight search, Siri and the Mac’s Notifications Center are typically on the far right side of the menu bar. You can remove unwanted menu-bar icons in a couple of ways. When you click on a status icon and open the preferences for the app, you may get a check box to turn off the menu-bar display. (You should be able to restore the icon in the program’s preferences if you later change your mind.) If you do not want to dig around in menus, you can also hold down the Command key, click on a status icon you do not need and drag it off the menu bar using the Mac’s mouse or track pad. For icons you want to keep but rearrange along the top of the screen, hold down the Command key and drag them into new locations. (However, they may shift positions when you restart, depending on which icons are open.) By default, Windows does not have a top menu bar and keeps its taskbar icons in a row along the bottom of the screen. You can rearrange taskbar icons by dragging them into new positions. If you want to redecorate further, you can change the location of the taskbar itself and adjust other aspects of it by right-clicking an empty section of the taskbar and selecting Settings.
