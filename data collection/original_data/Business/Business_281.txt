 Q. I often get interrupted by little pop-up windows showing comments from friends when I’m using Facebook on my computer. I looked in the notification settings for a place to turn off the pop-ups, but didn’t see anything. Am I stuck with these annoyances? A. Unlike the simple notification alerts that appear quickly and disappear, those windows that rise up from the lower part of the window when you are browsing Facebook are intended to keep you in the loop when your friends comment and start a conversation on a post you have made. (Facebook does not pop up windows for every conversation connected to your posts, but concentrates on the conversations it has determined you might care about the most.) The pop-up windows are more immediate than email notifications about comments on your posts. If you dislike the alerts, you can turn them off — but not in the main Facebook settings. Facebook refers to these windows as “post tabs” and has placed the controls for enabling or disabling them in the settings for its Chat feature in the lower-right corner of the browser window. Click the cog-shaped Options icon at the bottom of the page and select Turn Off Post Tabs to disable the pop-up conversation windows. This menu also holds options for turning off the chat function, video and voice calls, and other features if you want to make other adjustments. If you want to keep an eye on the conversation on some posts but not others, you can also disable the windows for the discussions you do not care about. To do that when a post tab pops up, click the cog-shaped icon in the top-right corner of the pop-up window itself and choose Hide This Tab.
