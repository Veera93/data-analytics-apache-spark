 Q. Can I make Microsoft Edge automatically fill in my address on shopping sites? A. Microsoft Edge, the default browser for Windows 10, has an AutoComplete function you can turn on in the program’s settings. The AutoComplete tool remembers how you filled in a form on a previous web form and automatically replicates the information as you begin to enter your address again so you do not have to type it all over again. To turn on Edge’s automatic completion feature, open the browser and click or tap the More Actions menu (shown as an icon with three dots) in the top-right corner of the window. When the menu opens, select Settings and then Advanced Settings farther down the screen. On the Advanced Setting screen, flip the button on next to “Save form entries.” After you fill out an address form once, the browser should remember it for the next one and offer to finish entering the information for you. AutoComplete is not quite the same thing as the “autofill” function available with some other browsers like Google Chrome and Mozilla Firefox (or, for Mac users, Apple’s Safari browser). Instead of offering suggestions to complete web forms, the autofill tool stores address information — and, in some browsers, credit-card numbers as well — and then automatically fills in all the form fields with a click or a keystroke. Third-party programs like Fillr’s AutoFill for Microsoft Edge, Dashlane and RoboForm can supply an autofill function for Microsoft’s browser. Keep in mind that the personal autofill data stored in a web browser can also be a target for hackers and malicious phishing scripts that can do things like quietly collect the information in web pages with invisible form fields. If you are concerned about online security, you may want to forgo convenience for safety.
