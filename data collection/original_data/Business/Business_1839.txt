 Good Friday. Here’s what is happening: • Dina Powell is set to leave the White House. • Trump says government won’t go easy on Wells Fargo. • Where’s the wage growth? • Being a mogul friend of Trump may not get you what you want. • Spotify finds a new partner ahead of a public listing. Like what you see? Get the DealBook Briefing in your inbox each morning. Here’s the sign-up. The New York Times reports: Ms. Powell was named deputy national security adviser in March, after serving as President Trump’s senior counselor for economic initiatives. Prior to joining the Trump administration, Ms. Powell ran many of Goldman Sachs’s philanthropic initiatives. Before that, she served as a State Department official and White House aide during the George W. Bush administration The tweet from President Trump’s comes after Reuters reported that Mick Mulvaney, the acting head Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, was reviewing whether Wells Fargo “should pay tens of millions of dollars over alleged mortgage lending abuse.” Since Mr. Trump put Mr. Mulvaney in charge of the consumer watchdog, he has pushed the bureau in a “new direction — one that takes a lighter touch to regulating the financial industry. The reversal is part of a broad push by the Trump administration to unfetter companies from Obama-era regulations,” The New York Times reported. The United States economy added 228,000 jobs in November, above the 200,000 expected by Wall Street economists, according to Bloomberg. The unemployment rate was unchanged from October at 4.1 percent. Average earnings grew 2.5 percent over the past year. The report comes as congressional Republicans are close to passing their $1.5 trillion tax cut plan. Here’s a roundup of economists’ reactions: Joseph Song and Michelle Meyer, Bank of America Merrill Lynch: “The lack of wage growth at the aggregate level despite the declines in the unemployment rate and strong job gains remains a mystery. One possible explanation is that structural factors such as unfavorable demographics and industry-specific dynamics are playing a bigger role than the cyclical factors. However, we continue to believe that a falling unemployment rate will ultimately underpin wages.” Ian Shepherdson, Pantheon Economics: He said the average hourly wage data was disappointing. “But if unemployment continues to fall, wage growth will rise. In the metro areas where unemployment already is 3.5% or less - these areas cover about a quarter of the employed workforce - y/y wage growth already is 4.0%. By the time the Fed meets in March, we expect to see sub-4% unemployment, accompanied by a clear uptick in wages and no softening in the payroll trend; we think Mr. Powell’s first meeting will bring a rate hike.” Joseph Brusuelas, RSM US: “The bottom line from the November jobs report is that the economy has shifted into third gear and investors and forward looking firm managers should anticipate a shift in policy in the new year that will bring rising policy rates, improved fixed business investment and strong household spending. Oh, and this is all happening prior to a potential tax cut that one rarely observes late in the business cycle, whose size is appropriate for an economy in recession, not one in the late stages of the business cycle. Stay tuned because this is going to get interesting quite quickly.” Robert Frick, Navy Federal Credit Union: “We soon may be adding a mystery of low wages to the mystery of low inflation, as the average hourly earnings registered just 2.5%. Even though the unemployment rate is 4.1%—and is expected to go below 4.0% next year—employers still don’t feel compelled to raise wages despite a tightening labor market.” Paul Ashworth, Capital Economics: “The annual growth rate of average hourly earnings was a very pedestrian 2.5% in November, but that won’t stop the Fed from tightening policy at next week’s FOMC meeting.” Mark Hamrick, Bankrate.com: “Given the potential impacts of the tax bill and the already established momentum of the economy, accelerating in recent months, there may well be a price to be paid in the form of rising interest rates at the hand of the Federal Reserve. The central bank has been eager to continue along the path of normalization and the case is made all the more pressing with the rise in stock and home prices. Even so, consumers and businesses have almost been lulled into virtual complacency by prolonged low interest rates.” Steve Schwarzman and Richard LeFrak privately made the case to President Trump that removing the deduction for state and local taxes from federal tax bills would hurt New York’s economy. Paul Singer and Ken Griffin want to change a provision that prevents hedge fund executives like themselves from taking advantage of a lower rate for pass-through partnerships. Andrew hears: So far, it isn’t clear whether being Trump supporters will help their causes. From Shane Goldmacher, Maggie Haberman and Kate Kelly of the NYT: The hit to New York City: Ken Moelis told Bloomberg that the elimination of so-called SALT deductions could meaningfully shift business out of New York and to low-tax states like Florida and Texas. The tax flyaround • The Senate’s requirement that investors with taxable brokerage accounts to sell their oldest stock holdings first, known as first-in-first-out, is creating headaches for brokers and tax lawyers. (Bloomberg) • The renewable energy industry had been on a tear. But the Republican tax overhaul could take a whack at its ascendancy. (NYT) • Family-owned businesses — including conservative darlings like Hobby Lobby — are worried that the tax bills put them at a meaningful disadvantage because of the way the businesses are structured. (WSJ) And it’s a division of one of China’s biggest internet giants. Spotify and Tencent’s music unit, known as TME, agreed to buy stakes in each other, forging a potentially crucial bond for the streaming giant ahead of its potential new life as a publicly traded company. Spotify is still weighing whether to list its shares in a direct listing, avoiding the complex process of an I.P.O. But being a public company means that investors will want to see impressive growth. Forming a partnership with Tencent helps give Spotify an important step up in that regard, by giving it a toehold in China. TME has also been the subject of speculation that it too could go public. Here’s the statement from Daniel Ek, Spotify’s founder and C.E.O.: Shares in the biotech are up 6% this morning, after Michael broke the news yesterday that Elliott Management is pushing for changes at the company. Alexion’s main drug, Soliris, is used to treat two rare blood disorders. The move again shows the power of activist investors. But the drugmaker will prove to be an interesting test for Elliott. The hedge fund is taking an iron-fist-in-a-velvet-glove approach. Over the past several months, Elliott executives have met with Alexion to make a variety of suggestions, from setting higher financial performance targets to considering exploring strategic alternatives. But the activist firm is prepared to take a number of steps if it feels that the company isn’t complying, including running a proxy fight for board seats. A big question: How much more can Alexion do? Analysts have praised the company and its management team. “I absolutely think they’re doing everything that investors could ask of them,” the research analyst Geoffrey Porges of Leerink told Michael. Another big question: If Alexion were for sale, who would buy it? Many biotech companies would be interested, especially since Soliris treatments cost patients hundreds of thousands of dollars a year. And if Alexion’s next drug, ALXN 1210, works out in clinical trials, it would be patent-protected for another 20 years. Extra credit: Fortune took a look at Elliott and some of the tactics it uses in its activism, from private investigators to hard-nosed negotiating. After several weeks of drama, Britain and the European Union have reached an important accord that will allow them to advance to the next stage of discussions. Here’s what Friday’s deal includes: • An agreement that Britain will contribute to the E.U.’s budget for the next two years and commit to paying its share of any future liabilities that arise before 2020, even if they come due in subsequent decades. • A path for E.U. nationals living in Britain to become permanent residents. • A compromise on the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice over both enforcement of any Brexit deal and the rights of E.U. citizens living in Britain. • A compromise on the border controls between Northern Ireland and Ireland. The pound rose a little, but trading was volatile. What’s next: The European Commission will recommend that E.U. leaders proceed to the next stage of Brexit talks, which are expected to begin early next year. Then, Britain will finally begin negotiations over a new trade deal with the bloc. • Morgan Stanley fired Harold Ford Jr., the former lawmaker who became a Wall Street rainmaker, “for conduct inconsistent with our values and in violation of our policies.” (NYT, HuffPo) • Sam Isaly, one of the most prominent investors in biotech companies, has been accused by former employees of verbally abusing and harassing female workers and playing pornography at the office. (STAT) • Laura Fitton, an early Twitter employee turned entrepreneur, became the first woman to go on the record with accusations of misconduct against the investor Shervin Pishevar.

(NYT) That’s when the trial for the Justice Department’s lawsuit to block AT&amp;T’s bid for Time Warner will begin. The judge presiding over the trial, Richard Leon, said that the trial would likely last three weeks. But while AT&amp;T has said that its merger agreement with Time Warner would expire on April 22, Judge Leon suggested pushing that back, since he wouldn’t reach a verdict in time. Extra credit: Read more about Judge Leon, whom the WaPo says “is considered a maverick in the legal world, having strong opinions and no clear political allegiance.” It passed $16,000 yesterday — and, on some exchanges, reached $20,000. As of this morning, it hovered around $15,000. Bad stuff has happened to Bitcoin this week: There have been security breaches, a note of skepticism from a major online retailer and warnings by Wall Street analysts. Digital currency enthusiasts haven’t cared. Companies in each industry are poised to take money from Masa Son’s SoftBank, and specifically from its $98 billion Vision Fund. Compass, a real estate listings service, said yesterday that it had raised $450 million from the Vision Fund at a $2.2 billion valuation — just a month after raising $100 million from Fidelity. SoftBank hailed the investment as the biggest ever in a real estate technology company. Also yesterday, Recode reported that SoftBank was in talks to invest about $300 million in DoorDash, one of the big food delivery services. Worth pondering: Both companies already compete in highly crowded industries, so it will be interesting to watch whether SoftBank showering them with riches helps them vault over more established rivals. Huh: Bloomberg reported that the Vision Fund was in talks to invest in two companies owned by the Chinese insurer Ping An. And Dan Primack of Axios reported that SoftBank was weighing an investment in Wag, an on-demand dog-walking service with a history of controversy.
