 Q. I have a bunch of notes in the Google Keep app on my Android tablet, but I’d like to move them into a word-processing program. Is there a way to do this from the tablet besides cutting and pasting the content into an email message and then into a document on my computer? A. Google Keep, the multimedia note-taking app for Android, iOS and the desktop web browser, can quickly transfer the text of a selected note to a Google Docs file or another program with a simple menu command. If you are using Google Keep for Android, tap open the note you want to use. In the bottom-right corner of the screen, tap the small square icon to open the Action menu. The menu offers several options, like adding a color or a collaborator. Tap the Send command and then choose either “Copy to Google Docs” or “Send via other apps.” If you use the Google Docs word-processing program, the text of your note is copied into a new file stored with the rest of your documents. If you do not use Google Docs, select the “other apps” option, which lets you send the text by email, post it to a social-media service, upload it to a connected cloud server or share it with another program. You can also drag Google Keep notes into an open Google Doc file right in your computer’s browser. To do so, open or create a new Google Doc. Go to the Tools menu and choose Keep Notepad. A “Notes from Keep” panel appears on the side of the browser window, and you can drag your notes right into the open Google Doc.
