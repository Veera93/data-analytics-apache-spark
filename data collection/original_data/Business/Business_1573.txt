 Q.  I see posts in my Twitter feed that have “sensitive content” labels in place of the message. What counts as sensitive content, and how can I unblock it? A. Twitter’s media policy generally does not allow images or videos depicting graphic violence, pornography or hate-group imagery to be attached to posts. Twitter users can report material they find objectionable by selecting the menu icon on the message and using the Report option. However, the company makes exceptions when the posted material is deemed to be “artistic, medical, health or educational” content. To shield users who do not wish to see such things popping up in their feeds, Twitter blocks those posts from view with the “sensitive content” label. If you prefer to judge the posts yourself, you can adjust your settings. Log into your account at twitter.com, click your profile icon on the right and select “Privacy and safety settings” on the left. In the Safety area of the page, turn on the check box next to “Display media that may contain sensitive content.” (Those using the Twitter for Android app can also do this in the app’s settings.) Likewise, you can make potentially sensitive content visible in Twitter searches by turning off the “Hide sensitive content” check box in the Search area. Click Save Changes when you are finished. After years of a rather hands-off approach to policing its users, Twitter announced last month that it will enforce its new restrictions against abusive behavior and other hateful conduct. The company’s full list of Twitter Rules can be found in the site’s Help Center.
