 Q. Are there any easy database programs I can use to make a visual catalog of my possessions for insurance purposes? A. Check with your insurance company to see if it has any specific tips or tools you should use to make a comprehensive list of your possessions. Some companies, including Nationwide and State Farm, suggest taking a narrated digital video as you walk from room to room in your house, and include the contents of closets, drawers and storage rooms. Although recent reviews have been mixed, Allstate offers a free Digital Locker app for Android and iOS devices that you can use to snap pictures of your belongings and make notes, The list is backed up online and can be exported as a PDF file or a spreadsheet if needed to make a claim. Similar apps with a range of features can also be found for Android, iOS, Mac and Windows systems. Search your preferred app store for “home inventory” to see what is available on your platform. Some inexpensive, feature-rich apps (like Memento Database for Android, Nest Egg for iOS or Sortly for Android, iOS and web) include barcode-scanning to automatically identify books and other items. Some apps also allow you to store images of purchase receipts to record the original value of the item. To make sure the inventory is around when you need it, back up the data securely in a separate location. Many inventory apps include an online backup tool to sites like Dropbox or their own servers. Airtable, an online spreadsheet/database app that allows you to add notes and pictures to entries, is another option. You can also log images of your possessions in web-based spreadsheets like Apple Numbers, Google Sheets or Microsoft Excel.
