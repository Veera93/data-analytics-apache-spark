 James Dashner, the author of “The Maze Runner” young-adult series, has been dropped by his literary agent amid allegations of sexual misconduct. Mr. Dashner’s agent, Michael W. Bourret, said in a statement to The Associated Press on Wednesday that “under the circumstances,” he could no longer represent Mr. Dashner. “I couldn’t in good conscience continue working with James, and I let him go yesterday,” Mr. Bourret said. Comments left on the website of School Library Journal, a monthly magazine for librarians, included allegations about Mr. Dashner, 45; Jay Asher, the author of “Thirteen Reasons Why”; and other popular writers of young-adult novels. Mr. Dashner’s publisher, Random House, did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Earlier this week, the head of the Society of Children’s Book Writers and Illustrators told The A.P. that Mr. Asher, 42, had been expelled from the organization. A spokeswoman for Mr. Asher disputed that he had been kicked out, but confirmed Wednesday that the author’s agent had dropped him. “Mr. Asher is no longer working with the Andrea Brown agency,” the spokeswoman, Tammy Taylor, wrote in an email to The A.P. “He respects and understands their position, given the current climate.” “The Maze Runner,” a dystopian science fiction series that has sold a million copies, is also the basis of a lucrative film franchise. The most recent release, “Maze Runner: The Death Cure,” came out last month. In 2017, Random House announced that Mr. Dashner was working on a book for adults called “The Waking.” The industry newsletter Publishers Lunch first reported that the agents of Mr. Dashner and Mr. Asher had dropped them.
