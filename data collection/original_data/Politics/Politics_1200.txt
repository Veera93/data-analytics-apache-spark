 Congressional Republicans seem to be very unhappy with President Obama’s new executive actions on guns, though they are probably quite happy that the actions provided them such a juicy issue with which to stir up voters in an election year. In that vein, Senator Richard C. Shelby, the veteran Republican from Alabama up for re-election in November, apparently wants first crack at questioning Attorney General Loretta E. Lynch on the administration’s rationale and legal justification for moving ahead on its own with the new rules. Mr. Shelby, chairman of the appropriations subcommittee that funds the Justice Department, has summoned Ms. Lynch for a Jan. 28 hearing to “discuss the president’s firearms proposals and any potential infringement on law-abiding Americans’ Second Amendment rights,” he said in a letter to the attorney general. Suffice to say that Mr. Shelby is not going to take any such infringement lightly or refrain from using his spending bill as leverage against the administration. “Let me be clear,” he warned. “I will not sit idly by and allow the department to implement unlawful, unconstitutional actions.” While the actual reach of the Obama proposals has been judged to be fairly modest, congressional Republicans are going to spend a lot of time talking about them since the issue has conservatives riled up on two fronts: gun rights and perceived executive overreach by the White House.  As he seeks a sixth term, Mr. Shelby is facing a potentially difficult primary challenge from the right, and he is taking no chances. As has been noted earlier, he voted against the recent spending deal passed easily by the House and Senate despite having played a significant role in writing it.
