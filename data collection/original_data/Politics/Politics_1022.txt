 One of the “super PACs” supporting Senator Ted Cruz is airing two attack ads against Donald J. Trump, using his own words against him to paint him as a liberal and as someone who has warmly praised the senator from Texas.  The group, Keep the Promise I, will put the two spots into rotation in Iowa and South Carolina as part of a $2.5 million ad buy before next Monday’s Iowa caucuses.  In one ad, called “Extreme,” a narrator intones that Mr. Trump is “not a conservative.” It uses a 1999 interview that Mr. Trump gave to Tim Russert, the former host of NBC’s “Meet the Press,” in which Mr. Trump said, “I’m very pro choice.” That snippet is played in a loop a few times in a row.  The second ad, “I Like Ted,” uses Mr. Trump’s speech at a dinner in 2014 in which he praised Mr. Cruz effusively. Mr. Cruz and Mr. Trump are in a close race for first place in polls of Iowa caucus voters, and the race between them has grown increasingly rancorous.
