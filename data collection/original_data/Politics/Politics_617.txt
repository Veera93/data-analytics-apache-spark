 Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont raised more than $42 million during February, his campaign said on Tuesday. More than $6 million of that money was raised on Monday, the last day of the month, when the campaign issued a push for donations with the goal of bringing February’s total to $40 million. The campaign did not release the amount it had on hand at the end of the month. The funds raised in February came from 1.4 million individual contributors who donated an average of $30 each, according to the campaign, which drew a contrast with what it called the wealthier donors supporting Hillary Clinton for the Democratic presidential nomination. “Working Americans chipping in a few dollars every week are changing the way campaigns in our country are financed,” Jeff Weaver, Mr. Sanders’s campaign manager, said in a statement issued after midnight. “Not only are we going to smash Secretary Clinton’s personal goal of raising $50 million in the first quarter of 2016, our supporters are putting Bernie on the path to win the nomination.” Mr. Weaver added that Mr. Sanders’s supporters are “a firewall protecting Bernie from the Clinton campaign’s wealthiest donors and super PACs.”
