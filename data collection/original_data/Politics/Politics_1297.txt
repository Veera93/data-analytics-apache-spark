 CLINTON, Iowa — Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey has a cutting message for Senator Marco Rubio of Florida: You don’t work very hard at your job. Mr. Rubio has a biting new retort: Neither do you, Mr. Christie.   In dueling appearances here in Iowa on Tuesday, the two Republican presidential candidates traded attacks over who was least engaged in his day job. “Dude, show up,” Mr. Christie said of Mr. Rubio’s failure to vote on a major end-of-year spending bill, which Mr. Rubio said he opposed. “Vote no. If you don’t want to, quit.” A few hours later, Mr. Rubio lobbed the same attack right back at Mr. Christie. “You know, Chris has been missing in New Jersey for half the time,” Mr. Rubio said during a news conference with reporters in the town of Clinton. He added: “Candidates, as we get down the home stretch, some of them get a little desperate and a little nasty in their attacks.” Mr. Rubio defended his record in Congress, citing a 90 percent attendance record. With his attack, delivered in Muscatine, Iowa, Mr. Christie seized on a potential vulnerability for Mr. Rubio: a history of missed votes since he arrived in the Senate in 2011. Mr. Rubio has said that missing votes, in many cases, is a political statement about the endless gridlock and inherent messiness of lawmaking in Washington. Mr. Christie, mocked in New Jersey for his ample out-of-town travels, has called that explanation “baloney.” On Tuesday, he described Mr. Rubio as a talker, not a doer. “He gives a good speech, Marco,” Mr. Christie said, before mocking him again for the missed vote on the spending bill. “Except he never showed up.”
