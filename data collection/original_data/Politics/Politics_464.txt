 Donald J. Trump’s campaign has reserved television airtime in Arizona, where primary voters will cast ballots on Tuesday, and where a super PAC supporting Senator Ted Cruz and his campaign are also running or preparing to run their own ads.  Mr. Trump’s campaign began reserving some airtime on Thursday morning. Mr. Cruz’s campaign has been running an ad similar to one the Trump campaign has used elsewhere, featuring the relative of someone killed by an illegal immigrant. Arizona is a state with a heavy immigrant population, and it was ground zero for some of the most contentious crackdowns on illegal immigration over the last six years.  The state’s former governor, Jan Brewer, signed a 2010 law that gave the police the authority to question anyone whom they had “reasonable suspicion” of being an undocumented immigrant. Ms. Brewer, a Republican, has endorsed Mr. Trump. So has the Maricopa County sheriff, Joseph Arpaio, whose round-ups of immigrants here illegally became famous nationally.  Recent polls have shown that large numbers of Arizona voters are undecided, and Mr. Trump’s lead, while large, might not be insurmountable. The patchwork of super PACs supporting Mr. Cruz, now called Trusted Leadership PAC, began reserving airtime in Arizona as well, intending to run an ad that suggests that Mr. Cruz is a rock-ribbed conservative who is also ready to be president — a consistent criticism of Mr. Trump.  In Utah, which also votes on Tuesday, the anti-tax group the Club for Growth said it would air an ad against Mr. Trump, hoping to keep him from another win. Utah is a caucus state, where campaign organization can be important, and Mr. Trump has tended to fare worse in those types of contests than in primaries.
