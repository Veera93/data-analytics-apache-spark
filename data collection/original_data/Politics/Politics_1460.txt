 Updated, 11:41 a.m. | Donald J. Trump postponed a planned interview with the former network news anchor Katie Couric, as the debate raged over his call to bar Muslim immigrants from entering the United States, a producer with the program confirmed.  Mr. Trump’s interview with Ms. Couric, who now does online interviews as Yahoo’s global news anchor, had been planned for Wednesday, said Tony Maciulis, the head of news at Yahoo Studios.  According to another person involved in the planning of the interview, it was set for Mr. Trump’s office tower on Fifth Avenue in Manhattan and had been in the works since the summer. The date was confirmed in the last three weeks, after an interview that another Yahoo News reporter conducted in the offices with Mr. Trump, in which the reporter asked him if he would rule out creating a registry of Muslims in the United States.  Ms. Couric has interviewed all of the major candidates except for Mr. Trump and Jeb Bush, the former Florida governor. She has also interviewed Mr. Trump before, and attended his wedding in 2005 to his wife, Melania.  In an email, a spokeswoman for Mr. Trump, Hope Hicks, said that the postponement was “purely a scheduling issue and we have every intention to reschedule as soon as possible.”   Mr. Trump, the leader in most polls for the Republican presidential nomination, has faced steep criticism since his call on Monday to bar Muslims from entering the country after the San Bernardino, Calif., terrorist attacks. He has no events on his public schedule until Friday.
