 CLEMSON, S.C. — The young man chosen by Gov. John R. Kasich to ask the last question at an event at Clemson University on Thursday started off by saying he did not want to get too emotional. Brett Smith, a student at the University of Georgia, told Mr. Kasich that he wanted to tell him and the crowd why he was supporting the Kasich campaign. “Over a year ago, a man who was like my second dad, he killed himself,” he said. “And then a few months later, my parents got a divorce, and then a few months later, my dad lost his job. And I was in a really dark place for a long time. I was pretty depressed.” “But I found I hope,” he added, his voice filled with emotion. “And I found it in the Lord, and in my friends, and now I’ve found it in my presidential candidate that I support. And I’d really appreciate one of those hugs you’ve been talking about.” Mr. Kasich, who often talks about the need to care about those who are left behind and who are struggling, walked down from the stage, hugged him tightly and whispered in his ear. “The Lord will give you strength,” Mr. Kasich told him. The young man wore a Kasich sticker, and he is volunteering at his college for the “super PAC” that is supporting Mr. Kasich, New Day for America, according to a spokeswoman for the group. Back on stage, Mr. Kasich said that, as he has campaigned, anguished stories like Mr. Smith’s were not unusual. “I’ve heard about the pain of people all across this country,” he said. “And what I’ve learned is, we’re going too fast in our lives.” “We need to slow down,” he added, “because there are not enough people who are helping those who have no one to celebrate their victories, and we don’t have enough people that sit down and cry with that young man. Don’t you see that’s what it’s about?” — CSPAN (@cspan) February 18, 2016
