 FAIRFIELD, Iowa — Seeking to insert himself into the latest Donald J. Trump-created campaign controversy, Senator Ted Cruz on Tuesday night challenged Mr. Trump to a “mano a mano” debate, suggesting that if the Republican front-runner was too frightened to face Fox News’s Megyn Kelly, the two candidates could face off without a moderator. Mr. Cruz’s dare came shortly after Mr. Trump’s campaign manager indicated that Mr. Trump was highly unlikely to join the cable news station’s Thursday debate in Iowa, the final forum between the candidates before the caucuses on Monday. The Texas senator, who is locked in a close race here with Mr. Trump, suggested at a town hall here that his one-on-one with Mr. Trump could be moderated by a conservative talk radio host — or by no one at all. “We’ll do 90 minutes,” said Mr. Cruz, who was an accomplished debater at Princeton University.  “Lincoln-Douglas, Mano a Mano, Donald and Me.” Arguing that Mr. Trump’s refusal to debate in Des Moines was an affront to Iowa voters, Mr. Cruz noted that he was on the verge of having visited each of the state’s 99 counties and likened the debate to a job interview before the electorate. “If someone didn’t show up at the interview, you know what they’d say? ‘You’re fired,’ ” Mr. Cruz said, seizing on Mr. Trump’s reality show punch line to laughs and applause.    At the event immediately preceding his town-hall event here, Mr. Cruz had vowed that he would not lob personal insults at his pugnacious rival. But as he set up his proposal, Mr. Cruz seemed to dispense with that pledge as quickly as he had offered it. “You know, Donald is a fragile soul,” Mr. Cruz said. “You know, if she asks him mean questions, I mean, his hair might stand up.” Mr. Trump’s aides did not immediately reply to a question about whether he may accept Mr. Cruz’s challenge.
