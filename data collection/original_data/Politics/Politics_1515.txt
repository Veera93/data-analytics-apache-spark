 Mark your calendars: President Obama will deliver his final State of the Union address on Jan. 12, an early date for the annual ceremonial appearance on Capitol Hill.  The White House recommended that date for a variety of reasons. The House was not scheduled to be in session the week after, ruling that one out. And holding it later seemed, from a White House standpoint, to be pushing it too close to the start of the presidential primary season, with the Iowa caucuses set for Feb. 1 and the New Hampshire primary on Feb. 9. This year’s address was held on Jan. 20. Administration officials clearly wanted to get out of the primary rush’s way, and it will no doubt thrill Mr. Obama to be done with the yearly task early. But such considerations have not always been the case. In 2004, the Iowa caucuses were held on Jan. 19, and the State of the Union by George W. Bush was scheduled for the next night, contributing to a crush at the airport as candidates, campaign officials and news media fled Des Moines for Washington and Manchester, N.H.
