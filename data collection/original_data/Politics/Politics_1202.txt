 Ted Cruz is on a six-day, 28-town swing through Iowa. These are the places, faces and culinary selections of 2016’s first proper bus tour. EVENT 17 Time: 7:50 p.m., Jan. 7 Place: Goldfield, Iowa (population: 635) Site: Goldfield Old Schoolhouse, in the cafeteria of a long-shuttered school now used for events Mood: night-school time machine On the wall: a copy of the Constitution, track-and-field times from the 1970s, 18-hole student golf record (Greg Schipull, 76 strokes, 1985)  Mr. Cruz on his daughters: Catherine, 5, “is sweet, sweet, sweet. She will curl up in your lap.” Caroline, 7, “has an ornery, cynical spirit that is wonderful.”  Movies quoted: “Jerry Maguire,” “The Usual Suspects”  Highlight: Mr. Cruz, responding to the question of a boy with an interest in politics, began discussing the example of healthcare policy. “Take Obamacare,” he said, pausing before the punch line. “Please, take Obamacare.” Modest laughter followed. “Sorry, a little Benny Youngman,” Mr. Cruz said. (He seemed to mean Henny Youngman of “take my wife … please!” fame.) The boy looked back at him. “Ask your grandfather,” Mr. Cruz said.
