 FLORENCE, S.C. — Hillary Clinton isn’t the only presidential candidate who found paid speeches to be a lucrative source of income after leaving public office. Gov. John Kasich of Ohio was also paid an eye-popping amount of money for very little work. And that’s by his own account. While Mrs. Clinton has been dogged by questions over her paid speeches, Mr. Kasich brought up his profitable speechmaking without any prompting on Thursday while speaking at Francis Marion University. “We’ve heard about Hillary getting all this money,” he said. “Lot of people, you know, they get paid a lot of money. I did great.” Mr. Kasich, who was elected governor of Ohio in 2010, was reminiscing about how pleasant his life was after he decided not to seek re-election to Congress in 2000. He worked for Lehman Brothers from Columbus, Ohio, a job that he has taken to freely joking about in speeches, defying the conventional wisdom that it might not be such a good thing to highlight ties to Wall Street. After saying that blaming him for bankrupting Lehman Brothers would be like “blaming a car dealer in Spartanburg for the collapse of G.M.,” Mr. Kasich went on to tell the crowd about the paid speeches he gave. For one speaking engagement, he recalled going to Orlando, Fla., to debate someone. Mr. Kasich said he was told they would have 15 minutes. It turned out that was for both of them, so, Mr. Kasich said, he wound up speaking for only about half that time. “We did our thing — I think I got maybe eight minutes, and the other guy got eight minutes,” he said. “And I got in the car and they handed me a check for $15,000. Yeah! Hey, these people get paid $200,000, $300,000, O.K.?” But Mr. Kasich said that as he sat in that car, he “got a message.” He had been contemplating whether to return to public life. “The message I got was, ‘Time to get out of that life you’re in, you got to go back,’” Mr. Kasich said. “And that’s why I was so certain that I could run for governor.”
