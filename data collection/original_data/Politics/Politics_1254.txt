 Conservative activists know they are not going to see a repeal of the Affordable Care Act signed into law with President Obama in the White House, even though the House is poised to send him legislation overturning the law  on Wednesday. But Heritage Action for America wants the current Republican field of presidential candidates to know what the expectations are should one of them win the general election. Suffice it to say, the group is not interested in hearing any more excuses about why a full repeal is not possible. In a letter being sent on Tuesday to Republican presidential contenders, Heritage Action laid out three points on health care that they would like to see draw an “ironclad commitment” from the Republican field. The group said the next Republican administration should agree to use all executive authority at its disposal to halt regulation of the insurance market under the new health law, ensure the new vice president presides over the Senate to guarantee “complete and full” repeal is achieved under special filibuster-proof rules, and then agree to sign a full repeal into law. “America cannot afford another four more years of Obamacare,” the letter concludes.
