 Citing the shootings at a community college in Oregon, the House Democratic leader, Nancy Pelosi of California, called on Friday for the creation of a select committee to address the issue of gun violence in the United States.  In a letter to Speaker John A. Boehner, Ms. Pelosi said the goal of such a committee would be to propose legislation to reduce the number of gun deaths.  In recent years, Congress has been generally unwilling to take up legislation that might be construed in any way as limiting gun rights because of the large number of lawmakers — Republicans and Democrats alike — who oppose such measures.  “The epidemic of gun violence in our country challenges the conscience of our nation,” Ms. Pelosi wrote. “Mass shootings and gun violence are inflicting daily tragedy on communities across America. As of today, nearly 10,000 Americans have been killed by guns in 2015 – more than 30 gun violence deaths a day. Yesterday’s terrible attack at Umpqua Community College in Oregon marked the 45th school shooting this year alone.”  Ms. Pelosi urged Congress to adopt a bipartisan measure to require tougher background checks, but said a select committee was also needed “to confront this crisis and report back common-sense legislation to help end it.” She recommended setting a 60-day deadline for the committee to make a report.  Such select committees are a politically sensitive topic these days because of Democrats’ complaints that a select committee on the 2012 attacks in Benghazi, Libya, is being used by Republicans to inflict political damage on Hillary Rodham Clinton, who is the front-runner for the Democratic nomination for president.  And Republicans recently announced that they would form a select committee to investigate allegations that Planned Parenthood had profited from the use of aborted fetuses in medical research. Planned Parenthood has denied any wrongdoing, and Ms. Pelosi has denounced the new committee as “the committee to attack women’s health.”
