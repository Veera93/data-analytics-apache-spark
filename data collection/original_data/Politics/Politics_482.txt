 Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, the Democratic leader, has been trying to yoke congressional Republicans with Donald J. Trump for weeks. In the aftermath of Tuesday night’s voting, he intends to make his campaign official on Wednesday in a speech to the Center for American Progress, a liberal think tank, blaming Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader, and the House speaker, Paul D. Ryan, for some of Mr. Trump’s rise. “For too long,” Mr. Reid is expected to say, according to prepared remarks, “Senator McConnell and Speaker Ryan have tried to have it both ways, giving Trump a slap on the wrist each time he says something detestable, but always committing to support him at the end of the day.”  “This is precisely the kind of moral cowardice that enabled the rise of Trump,” Mr. Reid is expected to add. “After years of refusing to denounce birtherism, McConnell and Ryan are now supporting the most prominent birther in the nation.”   “Why are they waiting to withdraw their support? What more do they need to see?” he is expected to ask.  Mr. Reid’s remarks come on the heels of a new campaign of sorts begun by the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, “Party of Trump,” intended to mock Senate Republican incumbents and candidates who have said they would support Mr. Trump in the general election. On Tuesday, Mr. McConnell said that Mr. Trump had called him and that he had suggested Mr. Trump “condemn” the violence that had sprung up at some of his rallies. Mr. McConnell said that he and Mr. Trump had had a good conversation and that he appreciated the call but that he would not go into any specifics.
