 Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, chafing at the suggestion that conservative criticisms of Planned Parenthood might have played a role in the attack at a Colorado clinic on Friday, lashed out on Sunday at the “vicious rhetoric on the left, blaming those who are pro-life.” Speaking to reporters in Newton, Iowa, Mr. Cruz said “we don’t fully know the motivations of this deranged individual” in the shooting, which killed three people and wounded nine. Mr. Cruz added, without prompting, that the suspected gunman, Robert L. Dear Jr., was “registered to vote as a woman.” He suggested that there was “very little evidence” tying the shooting to anti-abortion sentiment, a cause frequently invoked by Mr. Cruz and his fellow Republicans in the presidential primary.  When a reporter cited news reports that Mr. Dear had said “no more baby parts” after he was apprehended, Mr. Cruz replied, “Well, it’s also reported that he was registered as an independent and as a woman and a transgender leftist activist.” Aides to Mr. Cruz said he was not saying with certainty that the gunman was a “transgender leftist activist,” but rather highlighting how little was known about him definitively. “He was making the point that there isn’t enough information,” Rick Tyler, a campaign spokesman, said. “You can’t expect a full response to a story that’s developing. The point was there’s a lot of raw information going around that’s not confirmed.” Asked what news reports Mr. Cruz was referring to, a spokeswoman, Catherine Frazier, pointed to a website called therightscoop.com. Its post, titled “Was the Colorado shooter a TRANSGENDER person?!?!,” said there were voting records in which a Robert L. Dear Jr. was identified as female.  Over the weekend, Mr. Cruz was initially one of the few Republican candidates to address the shooting, calling it a tragedy but declining to refer directly to Planned Parenthood.
