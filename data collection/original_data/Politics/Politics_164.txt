 
The Republican Party banner was yanked at the seams on Thursday. Whether it unravels remains unclear.  The highest-ranking elected Republican, Paul D. Ryan, the House speaker, told CNN that he could not yet support the party’s standard-bearer, Donald J. Trump. The reason, he said, was that Mr. Trump did not yet bear the party’s standards, a sentiment emphasizing the effect of Mr. Trump’s statements about women, his aggressive comments and his positions that are at odds with the Republican platform in some cases. Yet Mr. Trump did not yield. In an uncharacteristically circumspect statement, Mr. Trump responded that he was not yet ready to support Mr. Ryan’s positions. The speaker is not only a favorite of Republican elites, he’s a powerful elected official who has been seen as a savior of the conservative movement from which he emerged. Mr. Trump said he hoped that the two could come to terms at some point, another rarity from the presumptive presidential nominee.  Mr. Ryan’s comments are not only about trying to leverage Mr. Trump to sand down his rougher edges, but they could position Mr. Ryan neatly for a presidential run in 2020, should Mr. Trump lose. He was the party’s vice-presidential candidate in 2012, and some of his supporters hoped he would run this time.  But the split indicates that it is unclear to whom precisely the Republican Party belongs. Right now, the party is a coalition of aligned interests stitching together a dwindling base of national support. The problem existed before Mr. Trump, but he shined a big spotlight on it.
