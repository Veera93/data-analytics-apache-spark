 BOCA RATON, Fla. — Trump University may be closed and embroiled in controversy, but Donald J. Trump offered his fans a free lesson in branding Sunday evening at an outdoor rally here. As he began to talk about two of his remaining Republican rivals — Senators Ted Cruz of Texas and Marco Rubio of Florida — Mr. Trump quickly transitioned to his favored nicknames for the two men. “Lyin’ Ted,” he said, before spelling it out, letter by letter, for the crowd: “L-Y-I-N-apostrophe.” “We can’t say it the right way,” he explained. “We’ve got to go — Lyin’! Lyin’ Ted!” Turning his attention to Mr. Rubio, whom he calls “Little Marco,” Mr. Trump spelled out his preferred nickname: “L-I-D-D-L-E. Liddle, Liddle, Liddle Marco.” “You know, you have to brand people a certain way when they’re your opponents,” Mr. Trump said, before relishing in perhaps his most devastating description of this election cycle — calling Jeb Bush, the former governor of Florida, “low energy.” “Like Jeb Bush — we call him low energy, low energy,” he continued. “And I don’t care talking badly about him. He spent $29 million in negatives on me, $29 million. Can you believe it? Of other people’s money. Of his lobbyist and his special interest money.” Finally, Mr. Trump concluded his education interlude. “But you’ve got to brand people,” he said, going on the describe the original Republican field. “So we started off with 17 people who were up on this stage, and what the hell did I know about this stuff? I’ve never done this before, right? So we start off with 17 people, now we’re down to four. Bush was favored, then Walker was favored, then another one was favored, they’re all favored.” “Now,” he finished with a flourish, as the crowd roared, “Trump is favored.”
