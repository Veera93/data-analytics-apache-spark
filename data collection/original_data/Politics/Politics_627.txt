 Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont raised more than $36 million in February and was hoping to hit the $40 million mark by the end of the day on Monday, his campaign announced. The amount — a huge sum for a candidate who has virtually no donors giving the largest contributions legally permitted — suggests Mr. Sanders successfully capitalized on his close finish in Iowa behind Hillary Clinton and his victory in New Hampshire, after which his campaign took in a staggering $8 million in two days. A $40 million month would suggest a continued surge in Mr. Sanders’s fund-raising: From April 30 to Jan. 31, he raised $54.8 million. Mr. Sanders’s announcement on Monday appeared intended to jolt the enthusiasm of his supporters after a dismal loss on Saturday in South Carolina, where Mrs. Clinton won in a landslide with an overwhelming proportion of black voters, suggesting trouble for Mr. Sanders in the Southern states that dominate this week’s “Super Tuesday” contests. His campaign did not disclose a cash-on-hand figure, however, leaving unclear how much money Mr. Sanders has to fight on beyond Super Tuesday. Federal Election Commission disclosures filed this month revealed that at the end of January, after spending heavily on television ads, Mr. Sanders had just $15 million in cash on hand, less than half of what Mrs. Clinton had.
