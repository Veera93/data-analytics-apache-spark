 It’s an iconic moment at any big congressional hearing — witnesses take their seats to testify and the whir from the cameras of photographers seated on the floor between the witness table and the committee dais confirms that the moment has been captured for posterity. Well, the House Armed Services Committee has had enough whirring. Committee officials say the noise is disrupting hearings, causing the committee to bar photographers from that space and to impose other restrictions that have gone over with the photo crew about as well as a spoiled negative. “It is the most restrictive rule in Congress governing photographers at hearings,” Jeffrey S. Kent, director of the Senate Press Photographers’ Gallery, said. Claude Chafin, communications director for the committee, said the action had been taken reluctantly, but that the size of the 63-member panel and the tight space in the room made the changes necessary. “It is hard for photographers to understand, but it does make it very difficult for the members to hear what the witnesses are saying,” he said. “The hearings exist for members to do important oversight work and the photographers can’t impede that.” He noted that the photographers would still be able to stand to the side during opening statements by the two senior members, and that the new rules would be reassessed in March. He also pointed out that the hearings were streamed live and that they were often broadcast by C-Span, so the public still had access. To the photographers, though, the rules close another window into Congress for the public. They say that some moments are best told through an expert still photograph. The photographers already operate under multiple restrictions on Capitol Hill and say they are distressed at the imposition of new ones. “I hope this doesn’t dissuade photographers from covering their hearings, because that will be a disservice to the public,” Mr. Kent said.
