 The debt-limit deadline is closing in, but the House has a few other matters to take care of this week — including the election of a new speaker. If things go as planned — and they often haven’t lately — Representative Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin on Wednesday will be chosen by his Republican colleagues as their speaker candidate. He would then be elected on the House floor on Thursday to replace John A. Boehner, who will leave Congress after 24 years. When Mr. Boehner made his surprise resignation announcement late last month, there was lots of talk that he could perhaps resolve a few of the stickier budget and spending issues before he left — “clean the barn up a little bit,” in his colorful expression. But the turmoil that has surrounded House Republicans in recent weeks has pretty much ended that discussion. The most pressing matter now facing the Congress is raising the federal debt limit in response to warnings from the Treasury that the United States will be unable to meet its financial obligations after Nov. 3, resulting in a federal default that would threaten the economy. Congressional Republicans have so far not settled on a strategy for increasing federal borrowing power — many Republicans refuse to vote for it under any circumstances — though Republican leaders have said they would act this week. Once again, it is going to be close. Lawmakers face another issue that has divided them.  A group of about 40 House Republicans have joined with Democrats to sign a petition requiring a vote on renewing the Export-Import Bank, which many conservatives consider a form of corporate welfare. That petition could ripen on Monday, setting up a bitter Republican showdown in advance of the speaker election a few days later.
