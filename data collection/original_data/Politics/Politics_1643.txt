  WAUKEE, Iowa — After his final event of a busy Wednesday, Jeb Bush posed for selfies, shook hands with voters and — wait, was that just a chest bump? Yes, yes, it was. CNN has the clip. Asked to explain why Mr. Bush, the former Florida governor, had bumped pectoral regions with another man — a City Council member, as it turned out — Mr. Bush obliged. The man, he said, “was a co-chairman for Ted Cruz, and he came up to me and said: ‘I’ve changed my mind after the debate. I’m for you.’ ” “I do that for every convert,” Mr. Bush said with a laugh, turning to a group of reporters following him. “Anytime you guys want to try a chest bump, I’m all in.” No one, as of press time, had taken him up on the offer.
