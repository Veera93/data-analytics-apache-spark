 From almost the first day he entered the 2016 race, Jeb Bush has cast himself as the cerebral, wonky adult in a room full of colorful, bombastic Republican candidates. After the rise of Donald J. Trump, and the terrorist attacks in Paris and San Bernardino, Calif., Mr. Bush doubled down on that strategy, using Mr. Trump as a foil to try to show that he was a serious candidate for serious times. On Tuesday, Mr. Bush will take his message of national security and somber foreign policy to New York and the Council on Foreign Relations, where he will give a high-profile speech that will emphasize both his implicit and explicit campaign message: that he is best prepared to be commander in chief. Mr. Bush plans to keep his remarks short, his aides said, to allow for the robust discussion the venue requires, and will most likely reiterate some of his earlier policies. In an August speech at the Ronald Reagan Library in Simi Valley, Calif., he outlined his plan to defeat the Islamic State, and more recently spoke at the Citadel, where he called for “overwhelming force” to take on the threat of radical extremism with a United States-led coalition, including troops on the ground. Mr. Bush’s aides expect a vigorous question-and-answer session, with varied topics — the Iranian nuclear deal and prisoner exchange, the recent terrorist attacks, the growing influence of China — likely to come up. “The Obama-Clinton foreign policy has contributed to instability in the world, and we are less secure today than when President Obama took office,” said Kristy Campbell, a Bush campaign spokeswoman. “Jeb has demonstrated throughout this campaign he is the only candidate equipped with the experience, temperament and depth of knowledge necessary to be commander in chief.”
