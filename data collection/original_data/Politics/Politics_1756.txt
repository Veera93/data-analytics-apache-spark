 Given that it is World Series time, let’s consider Wednesday the congressional equivalent of a doubleheader. The House will take up the new budget deal, which came together late Monday night, as Republicans gather privately to formally nominate Representative Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin as their candidate for speaker. The election will be on the House floor on Thursday. The two issues are inextricably linked. Mr. Ryan wouldn’t be in line to be the next speaker had House conservatives not helped push out Speaker John A. Boehner because of his willingness to occasionally compromise with Democrats and the White House.  Mr. Boehner would not have been able to compromise and cut a deal to try to avoid a federal default if he had not been a lame duck. Mr. Ryan would not be able to start as speaker with a clean slate had Mr. Boehner not cut the deal, which Mr. Ryan now criticizes despite its obvious benefits to him. We know, it’s complicated. But lawmakers in both parties were optimistic that the budget package would be approved through a combination of strong Democratic support and backing by Republicans, including members of the Appropriations and Armed Services committees who see benefits to their areas of interest. If the deal is approved, then it is on to the Senate.
