 As Congress reconvenes on Monday after the Thanksgiving break, it will head right into its annual end-of-year rituals, including spending fights and senatorial Secret Santas.  One tradition beloved by government waste-watchers was former Senator Tom Coburn of Oklahoma’s annual tome detailing 100 federal projects he viewed as wasteful: duplicative programs, expensive gadgets owned by the Department of Defense and, everyone’s favorite, seemingly oddball scientific studies or programs, like teaching mountain lions to walk on treadmills. They all got Mr. Coburn, a Republican, riled, to the tune of millions of dollars.  The report has been given a new twist by Senator James Lankford, who was elected in 2014 to finish Mr. Coburn’s truncated term. Mr. Lankford’s report, which will be released publicly on Monday afternoon, puts what he views as needless spending and regulations into one book, structured like a report on the National Football League. Here’s one example. Conference: Spending. Team: National Endowment for the Arts. Fumble: $95,700 to help fund a program that produces silent adaptations of Shakespeare in a Washington, D.C., theater.  Mr. Lankford also frowns on a National Science Foundation taxpayer expenditure of $374,087 to study senior adults’ dating habits. “Unless this federal match.com for seniors develops policy solutions to bring down the debt,” Mr. Lankford writes, “maybe this one is better left to the private sector.” Mr. Lankford joins other Republican senators, including John McCain and Jeff Flake, both of Arizona, who have made the denouncing of federal pork projects a central focus of their careers.
