  With a month to go before Congress must finish its 12 spending bills or face another case of shutdown fever, the Senate returns on Monday to focus on one of the least contentious of the measures — legislation funding veterans and military construction programs. Last week, Democrats dropped their monthslong objections to moving ahead with spending legislation over funding disputes. Republicans noted archly that the new willingness to work together might be tied to this week’s federal holiday. “They were afraid to feel the heat next Wednesday on Veterans Day, having stopped a veterans appropriations bill,” said Senator Mitch McConnell, the Kentucky Republican and majority leader. The Senate would like to approve the veterans bill by Tuesday night, allowing senators to return home to trumpet it during holiday observances. Lawmakers hope to send to the White House at least one or two of the individual spending bills, to show they can still do such a thing and to reduce the number that will have to be considered together as an omnibus spending package before the Dec. 11 deadline. Pushing through such a large measure is always difficult, and there is no certainty the House and Senate can get the job done on time. The approval of separate bills would reduce the impact of a federal shutdown if one occurred. The House took another approach to Veterans Day and is out of town the entire week.
