 Ted Cruz is on a six-day, 28-town swing through Iowa. These are the places, faces and culinary selections of 2016’s first proper bus tour. EVENT 25 Time: 12:25 p.m., Jan. 9 Place: Strawberry Point, Iowa (population: 1,279) Site: Back Home Country Cookin’, with boisterous guests in wooden booths beneath holiday decorations and Christmas trinkets Mood: Ted Cruz’s New Year’s Rockin’ Saturday afternoon Food: Homemade pie by Brenda Attractions within, according to outdoor signage: “Welcome! Presidential Candidate Ted Cruz,” “Pies” Dangers below: As Mr. Cruz spoke, his daughters, Caroline and Catherine, 7 and 5, played at his feet. “I’m a little worried they’re gonna tie my shoelaces together,” he said. “Every parent knows, it’s much more dangerous when they’re quiet.” He asked the crowd to kindly advise him if the girls began lighting his jeans on fire. Highlight: Mr. Cruz called on a woman who said she had four yes-or-no questions. “Yes, yes, no, yes,” Mr. Cruz said quickly, to laughs. In fact, the answers were: 1) Yes, he has read the Constitution. 2) No, he does “not remotely” think that Supreme Court decisions are the law of the land. 3) No, he does not support birthright citizenship. 4) No, he has not read “The Creature From Jekyll Island: A Second Look at the Federal Reserve.” But he has read “Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde.”
