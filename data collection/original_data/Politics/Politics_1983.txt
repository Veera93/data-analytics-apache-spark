 Gov. John Kasich of Ohio has largely avoided confronting his Republican rivals for the presidential nomination so far, saying that he prefers to introduce himself to the American public.  That changed on Friday when he took offense to the fact that researchers from Jeb Bush’s “super PAC,” Right to Rise, were found scouring for documents about him in a public library in Westerville, Ohio.  After tweeting about it on Thursday night, Mr. Kasich said Friday that the  “oppo” search  for damaging information about him was a sign that Mr. Bush’s campaign was wobbly and that voters were looking for other options. “I would think that they’re in there because they’re getting nervous,” Mr. Kasich said during a news conference where he noted that Mr. Bush was struggling in polls in New Hampshire and elsewhere. “Of course they’re going to look around at who might be the mature adult who knows how to reform and fix things and be a leader, rather than an administrator.” The more aggressive tone comes as Mr. Bush’s poll numbers continue to be soft, leaving an opening for Mr. Kasich to emerge as a moderate, establishment Republican alternative.  A tracker for Mr. Bush’s PAC was also found recording an event for Senator Marco Rubio this week.
