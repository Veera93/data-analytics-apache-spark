 Huma Abedin, Hillary Rodham Clinton’s longtime adviser, is scheduled to hold a conference call with Mrs. Clinton’s top donors on Wednesday evening, just hours before Mrs. Clinton is to testify  before the House panel investigating the 2012 attack on the American diplomatic mission in Benghazi, Libya. The call is billed as another installment of the “behind the scenes” conversations the campaign regularly holds for members of Mrs. Clinton’s finance committee. “Huma will be giving us an update on what Hillary is seeing as she travels across the country,” the Clinton campaign told leading donors in an email sent on Monday afternoon. But Ms. Abedin, who worked for Mrs. Clinton at the State Department and who regularly travels with her, will almost certainly be asked about the candidate’s much-anticipated appearance before the so-called Benghazi Committee. Ms. Abedin testified for eight hours before a private session of the panel on Friday, but she has said little about what she told the House members.
