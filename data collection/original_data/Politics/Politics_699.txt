 ELKO, Nev. — The diversity of Marco Rubio’s political team in South Carolina was so striking that his campaign boasted they were the face of the new conservative movement. Mr. Rubio, a Cuban-American, Gov. Nikki Haley, an Indian-American, and Senator Tim Scott, who is black, were like a Republican Benetton ad, as Ms. Haley joked at every event. But in Nevada, where Mr. Rubio is competing in the state’s caucuses on Tuesday, that diversity is noticeably absent. As he boarded his campaign plane for a day of rallying voters in the northern reaches of the state, his entourage was nearly all white and male. There was Dean Heller, the state’s Republican senator, and the lieutenant governor, Mark Hutchison. Representative Jason Chaffetz of neighboring Utah was along for the ride too. Representative Mark Amodei, who represents a district in this northern Nevada region, was scheduled to link up with them later in the day.  The dearth of brown or black faces might seem surprising for a state that has such a large Hispanic population, not to mention its fair share of blacks.  But the biggest fish in the race, the state’s Hispanic Republican governor, Brian Sandoval, is so far uncommitted.  In a religious sense, however, his Nevada team is somewhat less conventional than the usual Republican lot. Mr. Heller, Mr. Hutchison and Mr. Chaffetz are all Mormon, as was Mr. Rubio for a brief time when his parents moved his family to Las Vegas for six years before returning to Miami.
