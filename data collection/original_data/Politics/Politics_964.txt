 The hypothetical question of what would happen at the Republican debates without Donald J. Trump has loomed over the first six face-offs. That question is about to be answered. As Mr. Trump holds his event to raise money for wounded veterans, at precisely the same time as the Republican debate and as a form of protest, seven Republicans will be on the prime-time stage in Iowa. Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, the most practiced debater on the stage and Mr. Trump’s main rival in Iowa, is almost certain to be the main target. How he handles that will be important in the final days before Iowans caucus. Senator Marco Rubio of Florida, who is hoping to expand his vote share in Iowa, is likely to be chief among them, as he was in the last debate. Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey, in turn, has been attacking Mr. Rubio, escalating their feud in recent days. Gov. John R. Kasich of Ohio, on the rise in New Hampshire, may also feel some heat. Then there’s Jeb Bush, who has been inching up in some surveys, and who has been the target of Mr. Trump’s attacks since the outset of the race. Without Mr. Trump onstage, Mr. Bush will have to look for new ways to find a stand-out moment. But it is the challenge facing all the candidates. This is the last real opportunity that the candidates not named Donald J. Trump have to establish themselves for undecided voters, a fact that Mr. Trump was no doubt aware of when he decided to try to freeze the race by skipping the debate. As for Mr. Trump, it remains to be seen if he will face any backlash from Iowans for skipping the lone debate in the state. Nearly five years ago, when he bowed out of a planned fund-raiser for the Republican Party of Iowa after opting not to run, the anger from the state party was fierce, pointing out that he had broken a commitment to its voters. But the debates are being controlled by the national Republican Party, and so far, the blowback has been swamped by the coverage of Mr. Trump’s competing event.
