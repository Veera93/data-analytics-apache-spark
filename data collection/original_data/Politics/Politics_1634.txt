 In the buildup toward the second Democratic presidential debate, Martin O’Malley has ramped up his attacks on his two main rivals, Hillary Rodham Clinton and Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, specifically on the topic of immigration. Mr. O’Malley has been struggling for months to gain ground, and there has been little room for him in the primary. But he believes that his record on immigration-related issues is more established than those of Mr. Sanders and Mrs. Clinton. Mr. O’Malley has been telegraphing the punches he might throw on Saturday evening on the debate stage, such as highlighting Mrs. Clinton’s stumble on the question of driver’s licenses for undocumented immigrants in a debate in October 2007. Mr. O’Malley has a potential second issue to bring up: Last week, in New Hampshire, Mrs. Clinton highlighted her votes as a Senator supporting some version of a border fence.
