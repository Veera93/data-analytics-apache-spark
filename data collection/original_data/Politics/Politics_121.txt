 There was harmony, if not unity, after a series of meetings on Thursday between Donald J. Trump and the House speaker, Paul D. Ryan; the Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell of Kentucky; and other members of Congress.  Both Mr. Ryan and Mr. Trump had warm words about their meeting, though neither of them suggested that all their differences had been resolved.  The issue of conservative judges came up in the meeting. Mr. Trump said that he would soon release a list of his potential nominees for federal courts and that he had be working on it with the Heritage Foundation and the Federalist Society, according to an attendee at the closed meeting with House members. Mr. Trump asked the members of Congress to send suggestions.  But Mr. Ryan, armed with charts to show the budget process and why he believes cuts to entitlement programs are necessary, made clear to Mr. Trump that while he respected what Mr. Trump had accomplished, there were many voters in the Republican primaries who did not vote for him. His message: Those are voters he must still appeal to. Others also suggested to Mr. Trump that he needed to tone down his comments. And still others wanted him to back candidates down the ballot.  And so it is unclear how long this cheerful truce lasts. If it does, then Mr. Trump may have an easier time persuading his party’s “Never Trump” wing to come toward him.  If not, it could be a long summer.
