 Ted Cruz is on a six-day, 28-town swing through Iowa. These are the places, faces and culinary selections of 2016’s first proper bus tour. EVENT 15 Time: 1:37 p.m., Jan. 7 Place: Humboldt, Iowa (population: 4,690) Site: Gordy’s at Rustix, a lunch spot with high-top tables and a full bar Mood: Howling crowd, growling stomachs Food: Hawg wings, Gordy’s rustic tumbler, bacon-wrapped dog Cruz etymology: “If you look to the roots of the word ‘politics,’ there are two parts: ‘poli,’ meaning many, and ‘ticks,’ meaning blood-sucking parasites.” Cruz vision for Guantánamo Bay: “At capacity and with a waiting list” Highlight: Mr. Cruz called on a man with two questions: What did the senator think of American efforts to combat AIDS and malaria abroad? And what did he think of the new “Star Wars” movie? Mr. Cruz said he supported those efforts, then added that he had watched “The Force Awakens” on the night of the last Democratic debate. “As I saw Wookiees and spaceships and laser beams,” he said, “it struck me as much more realistic and down-to-earth than whatever the Democrats were talking about.”
