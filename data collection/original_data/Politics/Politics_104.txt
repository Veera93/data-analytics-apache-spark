 For months, a central question of the 2016 presidential race has been how much distance Hillary Clinton needs to keep between herself and President Obama. In the last 50 years, voters have shown little interest in backing the candidate of the same party as a sitting president. (The exception is George Bush, who succeeded Ronald Reagan.) But the country has grown drastically more partisan in recent years. Mrs. Clinton is relying on support from the Obama coalition to be elected. And Mr. Obama is relying on her to continue his legacy. And so the two will make their first joint campaign appearance next week, in Wisconsin, one of a series of events they are expected to hold together. Over the course of a toxic presidential race, both Mrs. Clinton and Donald J. Trump have accrued historically high negative ratings in polls. Mr. Obama’s numbers, perhaps as a result of the vitriolic presidential race, have improved. And he hopes that his endorsement of Mrs. Clinton, announced after he held a meeting on Thursday with her rival, Bernie Sanders, will bring the Vermont senator’s supporters to her side. Still, Mrs. Clinton needs to maintain a separate political identity from Mr. Obama’s. And so, while the accelerated endorsement from Mr. Obama was welcomed by Democrats who have been urging the party to unite, the general-election campaign needs to remain Mrs. Clinton’s show.
