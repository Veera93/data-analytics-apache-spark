 Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, dismayed at liberal criticisms of the restrictive reproductive policies favored by some Republicans, mused on Monday that there was not a “rubber shortage in America.” It seems he would know. “When I was in college we had a machine in the bathroom, you put 50 cents in and voilà!” he told a crowd in Bettendorf, Iowa, during an extended riff on the politics of reproductive health. The apparent nostalgia for Princeton University high jinks circa 1990 was not without context. Mr. Cruz had been asked at a town hall gathering where he stood on making contraception available to women who want it. Arguing that Democrats had concocted a fictitious “war on women” — and assailing Hillary Clinton’s positions on reproductive issues — Mr. Cruz said that conservatives had no interest in banning contraceptives. “This is a made-up, nonsense example,” he said. Intense criticisms of Planned Parenthood have dominated much of the Republican primary, with Mr. Cruz among the group’s most vocal opponents. On Sunday, two days after a fatal shooting at a Planned Parenthood center in Colorado, Mr. Cruz dismissed any suggestion of a connection between the shooting and the heated words of Republicans. On Monday, he argued that fellow Republicans had in the past too easily allowed their opponents to dictate the terms of debates over women’s health. “When the war on women came up, Republicans would curl up in a ball. They’d say, ‘Don’t hurt me!’ ” he said. “Jiminy Cricket!”
