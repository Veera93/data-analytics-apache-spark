 If Republicans are worried about a Donald J. Trump presidential nomination damaging the party down the ballot in November, Representative Ann Kirkpatrick, the Arizona Democratic who is challenging Senator John McCain, is offering a prime example of why they should be. With Mr. Trump leading his Republican rivals in the race for delegates, Ms. Kirkpatrick unveiled an advertisement on Monday that hammers Mr. McCain for his promise to support the eventual Republican nominee — even if it is Mr. Trump. Many party leaders have pledged to support whomever the voters choose, although some are keeping that promise begrudgingly and others, such as Senator Ben Sasse of Nebraska, are refusing to go along with it. As The New York Times reported over the weekend, the Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, is planning to tell Republican senators up for re-election that they can run negative ads against Mr. Trump in the fall. Ms. Kirkpatrick’s ad is a compilation of some of the most controversial statements Mr. Trump has made in the campaign so far. It includes clips of Mr. Trump using vulgarities; disparaging the Fox News anchor Megyn Kelly; calling for bringing back “a hell of a lot worse than waterboarding”; and expressing a desire to punch a protester in the face. It even shows Mr. Trump saying that Mr. McCain, a former prisoner of war, was only a hero because he was captured. Interspersed with that footage is Mr. McCain, the 2008 Republican presidential nominee, saying that he would support the candidate his party nominates in any case. The ad concludes with an image of Mr. McCain’s 2008 campaign slogan, “Country First,” and laments that 30 years and Washington have changed the Arizona senator. “No matter what Donald Trump says, John McCain would support him for president,” the narrator says. Lorna Romero, a spokeswoman for the McCain campaign, called the ad a “cheap, pathetic display.”
