 Hillary Clinton’s campaign is using Donald J. Trump’s proposal to ban Muslims from entering the United States as a fund-raising and list-building tool. On Monday night, Mrs. Clinton’s longtime aide, Huma Abedin, sent a mass email to supporters titled, “I’m a proud Muslim.” “I’m a proud Muslim — but you don’t have to share my faith” to know “my disgust,” Ms. Abedin, the vice chairwoman of the Clinton campaign, wrote of Mr. Trump’s proposal. “Trump wants to literally write racism into our law books,” she continued. “His Islamophobia doesn’t reflect our nation’s values — it goes far enough to damage our country’s reputation and could even threaten our national security.” With a call to contribute to Mrs. Clinton’s campaign, Ms. Abedin concluded: “We have to be ready to stop him.” Born in Michigan and raised in Saudi Arabia, Ms. Abedin has worked for Mrs. Clinton since she was a White House intern as an undergraduate at Georgetown University. Her fundraising email follows Mrs. Clinton’s posting of a tweet denouncing Mr. Trump’s widely criticized proposal. “This is reprehensible, prejudiced and divisive,” Mrs. Clinton wrote. “@RealDonaldTrump, you don’t get it. This makes us less safe.” Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont also sent an email to supporters on Monday night, asking them to “Donate $3 to our campaign now to condemn Donald Trump’s hate and racism.” “It’s fun for the political media to treat Donald Trump like he’s the lead character in a soap opera or the star player on a baseball team,” Mr. Sanders wrote. “But the truth is his language is dangerous.” He added: “Help me show the best of America — not the worst that Trump exemplifies. Help us win.”
