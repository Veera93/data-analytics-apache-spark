 MEMPHIS  — John Kasich, the only governor remaining in the Republican presidential field, said on Friday that he was “a little bit surprised” that Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey decided to endorse Donald J. Trump. But Mr. Kasich said Mr. Christie’s decision would not affect his campaign, and he immediately swiveled to highlight how he compared with his rivals at Thursday’s debate, saying that “it was great to be the adult in the room again last night, as people are saying.” As a presidential candidate, Mr. Christie had stressed the importance of electing a president with the experience that comes with being a governor, and he also had offered praise for Mr. Kasich, the governor of Ohio. Speaking to reporters after a town hall-style forum here, Mr. Kasich said that he had asked Mr. Christie for his support.  “You have to realize that, you know, you win some, you lose some,” Mr. Kasich said. “And it’s O.K. Chris has a right to do what he wants to do, and he did it. Good for him.” Mr. Kasich noted that “politicians make decisions for lots of different reasons, and they’re complicated.” “You just don’t try to figure it all out,” he said. Mr. Kasich said Mr. Christie would “always be a friend of mine.”  At the town hall event, he named New Jersey, whose primary is June 7, as one of the states in which he intends to compete, although that contest falls at the very end of the primary calendar.  And on Friday, the Kasich campaign countered Mr. Christie’s endorsement with its own endorsement from a New Jersey governor: Christine Todd Whitman, who held that office from 1994 to 2001.
