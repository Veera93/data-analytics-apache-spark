 Ted Cruz is on a six-day, 28-town swing through Iowa. These are the places, faces and culinary selections of 2016’s first proper bus tour. EVENT 23 Time: 8:20 p.m., Jan. 8 Place: Decorah, Iowa (population: 8,127) Site: Mabe’s Pizza, in a sweltering basement with a few more people than appeared fire code-appropriate Mood: Oven Food: chicken cordon bleu pizza, “Gismo” burger, one-half “broasted” chicken Delivery: “Anyone order a pizza?” Mr. Cruz asked, entering the room with two empty boxes. “That’s what you call a government pizza. You pay for it, it’s an empty box.” Payment: Mr. Cruz proposed a plan to keep President Obama, an avid golfer, away from his day job. “Can we take a collection to pay his greens fees every day from now until January 2017?” he asked. “He really can’t do much damage at Pebble Beach.” Highlight: Mr. Cruz was asked if he could support abortions in cases of rape, setting off a few murmurs in the room. “Plant,” another man said quietly. Mr. Cruz thanked the questioner but gave no ground: “Every life is a precious gift,” he said, adding that the issue was likely to come up “once, twice, maybe three times in the general election debates.” When the man repeatedly interrupted, Mr. Cruz moved on: “Sir, we’re not going to debate, sir. Sir, sir — free speech — sir. Thank you, sir. Next question.” The crowd applauded.
