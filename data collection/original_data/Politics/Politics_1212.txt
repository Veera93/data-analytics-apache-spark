 Ted Cruz is on a six-day, 28-town swing through Iowa. These are the places, faces and culinary selections of 2016’s first proper bus tour. EVENT 14 Time: 11:27 a.m., Jan. 7 Place: Pocahontas, Iowa (population: 1,789) Site: Pizza Ranch, an Iowa staple with Western flair and an expansive buffet Mood: Alcohol-free saloon Food: Cheesy ranch “stix,” cactus bread, sweet swine pizza Sign advice beside salad bar: “Mind your manners or you’ll get the BOOT.” Sign advice beside restrooms: “Never squat with your spurs on.” How Mr. Cruz counteracts claims that he’s against contraception: “Heidi and I, we’ve got two little girls. I’m very glad we don’t have 17.” Highlight: Just before Mr. Cruz wrapped up, a young woman near the back fainted, before quickly recovering. She was given water, and Mr. Cruz approached to check on her. “All right, good news, she’s doing O.K.,” he told the crowd. “The young lady heard the name Hillary Clinton, she immediately fainted.”
