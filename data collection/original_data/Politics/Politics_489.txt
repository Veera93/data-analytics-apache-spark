 PEORIA, Ill. — A point of contrast between Ted Cruz and Donald J. Trump: protester relations. Near the end of a Cruz rally inside a theater here on Monday, a voice rang out from the crowd. “Go back to Canada!” a man shouted, taunting Mr. Cruz about his country of birth. “Thank you, sir. Very charming,” Mr. Cruz said from the stage, as supporters jeered the protester. “I appreciate your being here, and I appreciate free speech.” He went on: “One difference between this and a Donald Trump rally is, I’m not asking anyone to punch you in the face.” The theater roared. Then, in a room full of Illinois Republicans, Mr. Cruz went in for the kill — moments after noting Mr. Trump’s history of donating to local Democrats. “So apparently,” Mr. Cruz said of the protester, “that gentleman was here collecting another check for Rahm Emanuel.”
