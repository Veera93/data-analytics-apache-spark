 
Senator John McCain of Arizona recently told donors that he was probably facing the re-election race of his life, given the likelihood of Donald J. Trump at the top of the ticket and Mr. Trump’s negative comments about Hispanics. Now, People for the American Way is out to remind Hispanic voters in Arizona just what those comments were. In a new Spanish-language radio ad to begin airing on Thursday, the liberal advocacy group takes Mr. McCain and Senator Jeff Flake, Mr. McCain’s fellow Arizona Republican, to task for refusing to act on President Obama’s nomination of Judge Merrick B. Garland to the Supreme Court. “Is it because they want to see Donald Trump — the man who called Mexican immigrants rapists and drug dealers — get to name our next  Supreme Court justice?” the announcer asks in the ad that will run for a week on Spanish-language stations in the state. The radio spot goes on to say that the senators need to “stop doing Donald Trump’s bidding.” The ad appears to be the first aimed specifically at Latinos over the court vacancy and Mr. Trump. Mr. Flake is not on the ballot this year, but Mr. McCain is, and Hispanics are an important Arizona voting bloc that Mr. McCain needs to do well with to secure a sixth term. He is likely to face Representative Ann Kirkpatrick, a Democratic House member. Mr. McCain’s comments on his re-election difficulties were caught on a recording during a private fund-raiser and were first reported by Politico last week.
