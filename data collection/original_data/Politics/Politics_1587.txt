 The “super PAC” supporting Jeb Bush’s presidential campaign will start showing television ads next week in Ohio, the home state of Gov. John R. Kasich — a rival candidate who shares a similar political space with Mr. Bush in the Republican primary.  The spots will begin on Nov. 30 as part of a three-week ad buy that includes Fox News, cable networks and a smattering of broadcast stations on different networks, according to Paul Lindsay, a spokesman for the pac, Right to Rise USA.  The group also plans to send direct mail in Ohio, he said.  Mr. Lindsay would not reveal whether the spots would be similar to the cheerful, upbeat ads the group has aired so far about Mr. Bush’s record. But since the primary in Ohio is not until March 15, the ads seem as much about driving down Mr. Kasich’s poll numbers as anything else.  Right to Rise has raised more than $100 million, and has reserved tens of millions of dollars in television air time.  John Weaver, a top strategist to Mr. Kasich’s campaign, called the ads “a quick and ineffective way to spend down their funds before Jeb is out of the race.”  Mr. Bush, the former governor of Florida, and Mr. Kasich share similar profiles within the Republican Party as battleground state executives who can appeal to more moderate voters in the primary.
