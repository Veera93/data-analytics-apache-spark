 First, there was Rick Perry. Then, Scott Walker. Will Lincoln Chafee be the next presidential candidate to pack it in? His campaign already on life support, a fledgling Democratic debate performance did nothing to bolster his White House hopes. Mr. Chafee, the former senator and governor of Rhode Island, spoke for just nine minutes, and when he did get to speak, he stumbled. “You’re going to wind up looking silly if you keep going on like this,” Wolf Blitzer, the CNN anchor, said to Mr. Chafee in an interview on Wednesday. Mr. Chafee says that he wants to carry on, but the numbers are getting increasingly daunting. Polls are showing him getting closer to zero, and he acknowledged that he has raised only about $30,000 from donors. Independently wealthy, Mr. Chafee has invested about $300,000 of his own money into his cause and has been running on a shoestring budget. He drives himself to events and makes only sporadic trips to New Hampshire and Iowa. Still, Mr. Chafee is holding out hope that his antiwar message can catch on and that Mrs. Clinton, Mr. Sanders and his other rivals will stumble, paving his way to the Democratic nomination. “It’s still early in the campaign,” Mr. Chafee said in a statement. “If they like my message, I hope Democratic primary voters will support me.” If not, he could be the next candidate to call it quits.
