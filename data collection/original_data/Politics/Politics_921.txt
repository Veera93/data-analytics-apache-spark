 SALEM, N.H. — Senator Marco Rubio of Florida and his team have complained — and complained — about the attacks the outside group supporting Jeb Bush has lobbed their way. But Gov. John R. Kasich of Ohio had a slightly different take upon coming under fire from Mr. Bush’s “super PAC”  — “Fantastic,” Mr. Kasich said. Asked about the attacks that Right to Rise, the group supporting Mr. Bush, has begun against Mr. Kasich in Iowa — a state where neither Mr. Bush nor Mr. Kasich is polling particularly well — Mr. Kasich seemed surprised, if not delighted, to be viewed as an encroaching rival. “Well, they got like a hundred and ten million dollars,” Mr. Kasich said. “They’ve spent $40 or $50 million trying to sell Jeb in a positive way — that didn’t work. So now he’s playing whack-a-mole. And he’s just beating everybody that pops up. So I was totally amused to find out that I’ve spent $140,000 in Iowa and he’s spent $40 million and they’re beating me up in Iowa. Fantastic.” He added: “I hope they just spend all their money over there. It’s really kind of hard to believe but look, it’s all part of this process. But I was frankly surprised to see that they were worried about me in Iowa.”
