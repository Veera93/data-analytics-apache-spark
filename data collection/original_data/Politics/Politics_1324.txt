 Senators who run for president are often criticized for letting their time on the campaign trail distract them from doing their day jobs. Missed hearings and skipped votes are par for the course. With the 2015 legislative session in the books, C-Span has gone to the tape to see which White House contenders were staying busy on Capitol Hill and who was keeping out of sight. Sometimes criticized for remaining too focused on his Washington work, Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont has remained the most productive in terms of the number of times he has spoken on the Senate floor (37). Next was Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, who spoke 19 times, followed by Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, who just dropped out of the race, with 16 speeches, and Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky with 13. In last place was Senator Marco Rubio of Florida, who spoke just eight times on 5 percent of the days that the chamber was in session. When measuring productivity by number of roll-call votes, Mr. Paul tops the list with 319, which is 94 percent of the total recorded Senate roll calls for the year. He was trailed by Mr. Sanders (311), Mr. Cruz (259), Mr. Graham (243) and Mr. Rubio (219). Mr. Rubio’s absence in Senate has become an issue on the campaign trail with some of his rivals urging him to resign if he does not want to do the job. As Mr. Paul, who is running both for president and for his seat in Kentucky, put it on Sunday: “The difference between Marco Rubio and I is I show up for work.”
