 A day before the Michigan primary on Tuesday, Senator Bernie Sanders will be the focus of a live one-hour, prime-time event in Detroit. The host? Fox News. Bret Baier announced on his “Special Report” show on Thursday night that the Sanders campaign had agreed to the town-hall-style broadcast. The Clinton campaign was invited, but “is unable to attend due to a conflict in her campaign schedule,” according to a release from the network. While Mr. Sanders’s appearance on Fox News isn’t necessarily out of the ordinary – he sat for an interview with Chris Wallace in February on “Fox News Sunday” – the network’s decision to host a Democratic town hall is notable, given that it hasn’t put on a Democratic debate since 2004. Last month, Mr. Baier pressed Representative Debbie Wasserman Schultz of Florida, the chairwoman of the Democratic National Committee, to let Fox News host a debate. She laughed at the prospect, giving little hope that such an event would ever take place.  “There aren’t a whole lot of Democrats who come on, and I always look forward to our conversations, Bret, look forward to sparring with you and some of your hosts all the way through the campaign,” Ms. Schultz said to Mr. Baier. In his interview with Mr. Wallace, however, Mr. Sanders said he wasn’t opposed to the idea of a Fox town hall. “If we were clear to understand what the guidelines were and what the rules were and to make sure that they were fair and the D.N.C. was in favor of it, I would have no objection,” Mr. Sanders said. The town hall with Mr. Sanders will be broadcast at 6 p.m., Eastern time.
