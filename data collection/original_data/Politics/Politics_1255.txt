 Ted Cruz is on a six-day, 28-town swing through Iowa. These are the places, faces and culinary selections of 2016’s first proper bus tour. EVENT 5 Time: 10:37 p.m., Jan. 4 Place: Missouri Valley, Iowa (population: 2,838) Site: Penny’s Diner, greasy spoon with checkered floors Mood: pep rally with a side of meatloaf Food: pitstop patty melt, chicken dance, hopped-up hashbrowns Service: Mr. Cruz poured cups of coffee from behind the counter, briefly stealing a glance at the cameras capturing the moment. “I’ll be taking breakfast orders,” he added. “Eggs over easy, hash browns, bacon.” Memorabilia: “A Pez,” Mr. Cruz observed, as a fan handed him a trinket to autograph. “That’s a new one. I’ve never signed a Pez before.” Highlight: Mr. Cruz, in a stump speech staple, joked that journalists will seek therapy en masse after his election. “They can’t afford it!” an attendee replied. Mr. Cruz could not stifle a laugh. “I consider the Cruz campaign remedial therapy for journalists,” he said.
