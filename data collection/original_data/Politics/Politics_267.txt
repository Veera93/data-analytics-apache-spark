 Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont released his 2014 federal tax returns on Friday, following weeks of questioning — by his rival, Hillary Clinton, and the media — and promises that he would do so. The couple’s income — $205,617 in 2014 — includes $156,441 in wages and salary and $46,213 from Social Security benefits, although some of those benefits are not taxable, according to seven pages of tax returns released by the Sanders campaign. The returns, which were prepared by Mr. Sanders’s wife, Jane, also show that the couple gave $8,350 as gifts to charity and paid $27,653 in federal income taxes. For weeks, Mr. Sanders had said he would release his tax returns, saying he had not done so previously because Ms. Sanders does the couple’s taxes but she had been campaigning alongside him for months. Mrs. Clinton challenged him during Thursday night’s Democratic debate to release several years of his tax returns, not just the 2014 returns. “There is a longstanding expectation that everybody running release their tax returns, and you can go to my website and see eight years of tax returns,” Mrs. Clinton said. “And I’ve released 30 years of tax returns. And I think every candidate, including Senator Sanders and Donald Trump, should do the same.” Mr. Sanders responded by calling on Mrs. Clinton to release transcripts of paid speeches she gave before commercial banks. She said she would when other candidates did the same, although Mr. Sanders said he had not given such paid speeches. However, when pressed by CNN’s Wolf Blitzer about his returns, Mr. Sanders said he would release his 2014 tax returns Friday. “I don’t want to get anybody very excited,” Mr. Sanders said Thursday. “They are very boring tax returns. No big money from speeches, no major investments. Unfortunately — unfortunately, I remain one of the poorer members of the United States Senate. And that’s what that will show.”
