 In a technical move that could be viewed as a prerequisite to announcing an independent bid for the presidency, former Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg’s personal website was recently transferred to an independent web server — away from servers run by his company. Until Feb. 14, the website, MikeBloomberg.com, had been hosted on a server run by Bloomberg L.P., Mr. Bloomberg’s financial information company, according to records from the cyberforensics company DomainTools. It was in mid-February that speculation about Mr. Bloomberg’s political intentions peaked, with Senator Bernie Sanders gaining momentum in his bid for the Democratic nomination. But the recent victories by Hillary Clinton in the Democratic nominating contest are believed to have eroded the rationale for a candidacy by Mr. Bloomberg, who is said to have feared the prospect of either Mr. Sanders or Donald J. Trump in the White House. When Mr. Bloomberg ran for mayor and subsequently served in City Hall, he kept his political work separate from his business. He stepped down from the leadership of his company and only retook control of it after his three terms as mayor ended. Corporations, even privately held ones like Mr. Bloomberg’s namesake firm, may not make contributions of cash or services to candidates under federal campaign finance law. So, business executives running for office can either divorce their campaign from their business, as Mr. Bloomberg did when he ran for mayor, or painstakingly reimburse their company from their campaign funds. Mr. Trump has chosen to reimburse. The website is now hosted on a server run by Amazon.com, which is a provider of web hosting and cloud services. A spokesman for Mr. Bloomberg declined to comment.
