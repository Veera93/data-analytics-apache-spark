 Ted Cruz is on a six-day, 28-town swing through Iowa. These are the places, faces and culinary selections of 2016’s first proper bus tour. EVENT 18 Time: 10:22 a.m., Jan. 8 Place: Mason City, Iowa (population: 28,078) Site: Praise Community Church, a modest space with clear square windows and a drum set onstage. Mood: Sunday best, with Cruz lapel stickers DVDs available: “Ben Hur” (animated version); “The Ten Commandments” (animated version); “Left Behind II: Tribulation Force,” starring Kirk Cameron Iowa dining appreciation, via Representative Steve King: “If you can get it down, it’s good. If you can keep it down, it’s better.” Best prop: “Our whole family unicycles,” Christa Hanson, 21, said, rolling her single wheel through the church. Runner-up: “Did she say I’m the fastest juggler in the world?” Ms. Hanson’s father, Mark Hanson, asked, clutching five balls. (News clips attest to his prowess.) Highlight: Mr. Cruz, who places faith at the center of his campaign pitch at all stops, took particular care to project a preacher’s cadence in his closing. He asked the crowd to spend one minute a day in prayer until caucus day. “One minute, lifting our country up in prayer,” he said, his eyes narrowing as the cheers swelled. “Father God, please, keep this awakening going.”
