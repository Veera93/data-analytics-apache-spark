 
Those pushing the stalled nomination of Judge Merrick B. Garland to the Supreme Court had hoped that Donald J. Trump’s triumph in the Republican presidential primary would lead to a breakthrough with Senate Republicans who might suddenly see Judge Garland as an acceptable choice, rather than wait for Mr. Trump to lose and allow either Hillary Clinton or Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont to make the pick. Some conservatives, including the editors of the website RedState, agreed, urging Senate Republicans to act “before it was too late” and not allow President Obama to withdraw Judge Garland’s nomination. But it was not to be — at least not yet.  Don Stewart, a spokesman for Senator Mitch McConnell, the Kentucky Republican and majority leader, made it clear on Wednesday that Mr. McConnell had not changed his mind about holding firm against the Garland nomination. “Republicans continue to believe that the American people should have a voice in this decision and the next president should make the nomination,” Mr. Stewart said. That view attracted backing from other conservatives with influence in the nomination fight, as well as Tea Party activists. They called on Republicans to stay the course and await the outcome of the election rather than surrender now and assure a shift in the ideological balance of the court. The stalemate continues.
