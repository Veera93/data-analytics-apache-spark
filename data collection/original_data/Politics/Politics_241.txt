 The conservative political network created by the billionaire brothers Charles G. and David H. Koch has broken up its opposition-research unit in the last few weeks, a spokesman for the group confirmed on Thursday, describing it as an efficiency measure. The majority of the researchers in what was known as the intelligence unit have been absorbed elsewhere in the Koch network. The unit was the subject of an extensive story in Politico last year. “We are constantly looking for ways to increase efficiency, optimize our efforts, and to ensure we have an operation that will help us build a movement of millions to advance our issues and reverse the trajectory of what is quickly becoming a two-tiered society,” said James Davis, a spokesman for the Koch-backed Freedom Partners Chamber of Commerce. The unit’s main role was to gather intelligence on other political groups, notably liberal ones such as the Democracy Alliance donor network. The unit had been run by Mike Roman, a veteran of opposition research, the deep investigative efforts that many political campaigns employ to try to uncover problems in their rivals’ pasts, or to keep track of their activities.  It was unclear whether Mr. Roman would remain on with the Koch network in some capacity. The unit has been the subject of intense scrutiny as the Kochs have tried to refashion their public image. Democrats have often used the Kochs as a cudgel against the Republican Party at large, denouncing them as secretive magnates who funnel money to policies that mostly help their own bottom lines. Those attacks have stuck over the last six years, and the Kochs have sought to highlight their charitable work and efforts at overhauling the criminal justice system.
