 Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky will retain his place on the main stage when the Republican presidential candidates debate on Tuesday, CNN said on Sunday, sparing Mr. Paul from what could have been a setback for his campaign. On Saturday, aides to Mr. Paul had indicated they would fight any decision by CNN to drop the senator to the so-called undercard debate when the candidates gather on Tuesday in Las Vegas. Mr. Paul was at risk of falling out of the main event because of his low poll numbers. To qualify for the main stage, candidates needed to reach an average of at least 3.5 percent nationally or 4 percent in either Iowa or New Hampshire between Oct. 29 and Dec. 13, according to CNN’s criteria. The poll averages would not be rounded, CNN said. On Sunday, CNN reported on its website that Mr. Paul “was saved at the 11th hour by showing viability in Iowa” in a poll by Fox News released on Sunday, which showed Mr. Paul at 5 percent. Asked about Mr. Paul’s inclusion, Lauren Pratapas, a CNN spokeswoman, said: “In the light of new polling released this morning and in the spirit of being as inclusive as possible, CNN has decided to include Sen. Rand Paul in the prime-time debate.” CNN said that nine Republicans will participate in the main debate, including Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey, who was relegated to the undercard debate when the candidates last faced off, on Fox Business on Nov. 10 in Milwaukee. At Tuesday’s debate, Donald J. Trump will be at center stage, flanked by Ben Carson and Senator Ted Cruz of Texas. In addition to Mr. Paul and Mr. Christie, they will be joined by Senator Marco Rubio of Florida, former Gov. Jeb Bush of Florida, Carly Fiorina and Gov. John Kasich of Ohio. The undercard debate will feature Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, former Gov. Mike Huckabee of Arkansas, former Gov. George E. Pataki of New York and former Senator Rick Santorum of Pennsylvania.
