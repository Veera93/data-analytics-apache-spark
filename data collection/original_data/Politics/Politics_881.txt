 Who cares who wins the presidential election? New Hampshire may have yet to get its say, but someone is going to get elected. And that means someone will be inaugurated. So while voters can fill in the blank in November, Congress on Wednesday took the first steps toward planning the party, as the House formally adopted a resolution establishing a Joint Congressional Committee on Inaugural Ceremonies. From here on out, “referred to as ‘the joint committee,’ ” as the resolution stated. The Senate adopted the resolution on Jan. 20, precisely one year before the anticipated festivities. According to the resolution, the joint committee, consisting of three senators and three members of the House, “is authorized to make the necessary arrangements for the inauguration of the president-elect and vice president-elect of the United States on January 20, 2017.” (Comforting to know it’s not for the president-elect of Nauru.) The joint committee, by congressional decree, is authorized to use the necessary equipment, personnel and services of the federal government. And, perhaps most important to taxpayers, the joint committee “may accept gifts and donations of goods and services to carry out its responsibilities.”
