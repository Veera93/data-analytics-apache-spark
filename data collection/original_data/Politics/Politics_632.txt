 Senate Republicans are hoping to get back to business this week and shift attention away from the political fight raging over the Supreme Court vacancy with the consideration of a bipartisan measure on drug addiction and treatment.  Senators have embraced the bill as an election-year effort to combat the heroin epidemic affecting parts of the nation by emphasizing treatment and education, calling for better scrutiny of prescription narcotics and granting emergency crews more access to drugs that can treat overdoses.  Senator John Cornyn of Texas, the No. 2 Senate Republican and a supporter of the measure, last week called on Democrats to lower the volume on attacks over the court. “This is a matter of disagreement,” he said. “There is no question about it. But it doesn’t mean that just because we are divided along party lines on this matter, that there’s other things we can’t do together.” Democrats are likely to heed at least part of Mr. Cornyn’s plea and to cooperate in advancing the drug measure. They do not want Republicans to be able to flip the script and label Democrats as obstructionists, particularly on an issue like drug abuse and treatment. But as for slowing the drumbeat, Mr. Cornyn will probably be disappointed. Democrats believe they have the high ground on this issue, and they are not about to let up on Republicans.  With the White House likely to name a nominee, Democrats and their allies in the activist world will keep Republicans in their sights even as they appear cooperative on other issues such as the drug measure and a still-pending energy bill.
