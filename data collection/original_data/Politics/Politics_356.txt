 The Senate is back on Monday after a two-week break, and the Supreme Court vacancy, which dominated much of the recess, will return to center stage in Washington this week. Judge Merrick B. Garland, nominated by President Obama to succeed Justice Antonin Scalia, is scheduled to meet on Tuesday with two Republican senators: Susan Collins of Maine and John Boozman of Arkansas. He met with Senator Mark S. Kirk, Republican of Illinois, last week. Despite the meetings, party leaders believe they are holding the line on the nomination, with little wavering by Republicans in the face of a strong push by Democratic groups against Republican senators in their home states.  FreedomWorks, one of the conservative groups supporting Senate Republicans in their decision not to act on the nomination, warned Republicans against agreeing to meet with Judge Garland to avoid providing any momentum for his confirmation. “By foolishly agreeing to meet with Obama’s nominee, Republicans are playing with fire, and they can’t blame the conservative grass-roots when they get burned,” said Adam Brandon, the group’s president and chief executive. Judge Garland is also scheduled to meet with nine Democratic senators this week. And Mr. Obama is expected to make a case for Senate consideration of his nominee when he meets with students at the University of Chicago law school this week.
