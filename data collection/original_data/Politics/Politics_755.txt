 A group of leading liberal economists who served in the Obama and Clinton administrations have assessed the proposals of Bernie Sanders and concluded that the Vermont senator’s rosy economic projections do not add up. In a letter to Mr. Sanders and Gerald Friedman, a University of Massachusetts at Amherst professor who has said that Mr. Sanders’s economic policies are would yield surging growth and job gains, they warn that “no credible economic research” supports those conclusions. “Making such promises runs against our party’s best traditions of evidence-based policy making and undermines our reputation as the party of responsible arithmetic,” wrote Alan Krueger, Austan Goolsbee, Christina Romer and Laura D’Andrea Tyson in a letter sent on Wednesday. Mr. Krueger, Mr. Goolsbee and Ms. Romer all chaired President Obama’s Council of Economic Advisers at different times during his administration. Mr. Krueger has informally discussed economic policy with the Clinton campaign but has no advisory role. Ms. Tyson led the council from 1993 to 1995, during former President Bill Clinton’s administration. Other left-leaning economists have also expressed doubts that Mr. Sanders’s proposals mesh with economic reality. Mr. Sanders has proposed increasing taxes on the rich to pay for a “Medicare-for-all” style health system and an overhaul to the education system that would eliminate tuition at public colleges. The economists, who are all respected as luminaries in the field, said that Mr. Sanders’s economic projections are as irresponsible as those promoted by Republicans who claim that deep tax cuts will jump start the economy. “These claims undermine the credibility of the progressive economic agenda and make it that much more difficult to challenge the unrealistic claims made by Republican candidates,” they wrote.
