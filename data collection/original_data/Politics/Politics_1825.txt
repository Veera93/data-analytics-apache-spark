 Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. may have taken some subtle digs at Hillary Rodham Clinton when announcing that he decided not to face off against her for the Democratic nomination, but the former secretary of state responded with nothing but kind words. “I am confident that history isn’t finished with Joe Biden,” Mrs. Clinton said in a statement. “As he said today, there is more work to do.” — Hillary Clinton (@HillaryClinton) October 21, 2015  Other candidates who were bracing for the possibility of competing with Mr. Biden also expressed warm wishes. “Joe Biden, a good friend, has made the decision that he feels is best for himself, his family and the country,” Senator Bernie Sanders said in a note of thanks for his public service. Martin O’Malley, who has been running a distant third place against Mrs. Clinton for the nomination, said that Mr. Biden’s “experience would have been a welcome addition to the race” and praised his strength in the face of tragedy, alluding to the recent death of the vice president’s son Beau. Republicans, who tried to spin the decision as a positive for their party and the Republican National Committee, said the absence of Mr. Biden would be a “blow” to Democrats who now seem to be stuck with Mrs. Clinton as their standard-bearer. Donald J. Trump, the Republican who is leading most polls, echoed that sentiment when he said that he would be happier facing Mrs. Clinton in a general election.   — Donald J.
