 Donald J. Trump’s campaign continued its outreach to Congress on Thursday, promising that the Republican candidate would become more presidential and organized as he lurches closer to the nomination. Representative Chris Collins, one of Mr. Trump’s congressional co-chairmen, and Ed Brookover, a senior adviser to Mr. Trump, met with a group of about 10 members of Congress in Washington to provide an update on the coming state voting contests and help lawmakers who are up for re-election become more comfortable with the candidate. “Most members are not going to be using the words, ‘I’m endorsing’ someone, but I can assure you of this, with one or two exceptions, the Republican members of congress will be supporting our nominee to defeat Hillary Clinton,” Mr. Collins, a Republican from New York, said after the meeting at the Capitol Hill Club. “She’s the great uniter of the Republican Party.” The Trump campaign has begun discussing using Mr. Trump’s three oldest children — the product of his marriage to his first wife, Ivana — as potential surrogates to call unbound delegates and make the case for supporting their father.  In the meeting, the Trump aides also discussed their plan to open their campaign’s Washington office in the coming days, according to someone briefed. Mr. Collins said that he has been sharing talking points with members of Congress that they can bring back to their districts to help educate their constituents about Mr. Trump and his plans to renegotiate trade deals and bring back manufacturing jobs from China. He also suggested lawmakers who have been reluctant to support Mr. Trump are starting to come around as the campaign becomes more sophisticated and Mr. Trump focuses more on policy. “You’re going to start seeing a presidential Mr. Trump,” Mr. Collins said. “It’s amazing how winners attract support.”
