 Gov. John Kasich of Ohio has become one of the Republican Party’s fiercest critics of Donald J. Trump, even likening his policy proposals to those of the Nazis. On Monday, Mr. Kasich took Mr. Trump to task again in a new advertisement that paints the billionaire businessman as too heartless for the presidency and highlights his recent mocking of a disabled reporter. The ad, titled “Is he worthy?,” features Mr. Trump at a rally defending his claim that Muslims cheered in Jersey City after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks. Mr. Trump points to an article in The Washington Post that he says supports his claim and then mocks the reporter who wrote the article, Serge Kovaleski, who is now at The New York Times. “Ah, I don’t know what I said,” the ad shows Mr. Trump saying, while contorting his face and hand. “I don’t remember.” Mr. Kovaleski has a chronic condition that affects his mobility, and Mr. Trump appeared to be imitating his handicap. Mr. Kasich’s advertisement intersperses news clips of Mr. Trump at the rally with news media reports of him denying that he knows Mr. Kovaleski or was aware of his condition. In fact, the two met on several occasions over the years. The ad concludes with an image of Mr. Trump convulsing on stage followed by pictures of several former presidents, including Washington, Lincoln, both Roosevelts, Eisenhower and Reagan. It then asks voters to ask themselves if Mr. Trump is in their league. “Is someone like Donald Trump really worthy of following in their footsteps?” the narrator asks. “Is he?”
