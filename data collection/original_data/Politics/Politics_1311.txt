 Is the art of letter writing really dead? Not if the “super PAC” supporting Jeb Bush has its way. The group Right to Rise is asking Bush supporters to revive the lost art of writing letters, in the form of hand-written appeals to undecided voters in New Hampshire. In a preholiday mailer, the group thanked its supporters for their financial support, and asked them to make “a different kind of gift to Jeb by giving a few minutes of your time.” The mailer included stationery and pre-addressed envelopes for five undecided voters in New Hampshire.  It urged donors to dash off a quick missive explaining why Mr. Bush deserved their vote. “We are asking you to personally reach out and let these voters know why you support Jeb,”  said the mailer, which also includes a sample note to send voters. New Hampshire is a critical state for Mr. Bush, who has to finish in the top tier — as well as ahead of his rivals for the Republican Party’s establishment vote — if he hopes to reassure skittish donors and revive his foundering presidential bid. The appeal has echoes of Mr. Bush’s father, President George H. W. Bush, a noted letter-writer and correspondent who once even released his own book of letters, “All the Best, George Bush: My Life in Letters and Other Writings.” And while Right to Rise’s handwritten pitch feels almost quaint in the era of social media and 140-character messages, such personal touches can sometimes help persuade undecided voters. Right to Rise is hoping to help Mr. Bush in New Hampshire in other ways as well. The group has reserved more than $10 million in television airtime between Jan. 1 and the state’s Feb. 9 primary, a purchase that includes two ads to run during the Super Bowl.
