 Jon Stewart, the former host of “The Daily Show,” was in Washington on Thursday, pushing, yet again, for Congress to adopt a law that would aid first responders suffering from health ailments related to the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attack in New York City.  Mr. Stewart was in the basement, near the underground trains that shuttle senators between the Capitol and their offices in adjacent buildings, when Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, a Republican presidential candidate, appeared.  “Lindsey Graham is on the bill!” Mr. Stewart shouted, leading firefighters who were with him in loud applause. The senator and the comedian greeted each other with a fist bump.  “How’s retirement?” Mr. Graham asked.  “You should try it sometime,” Mr. Stewart shot back. Mr. Graham laughed. “Some people want me to,” he said. Mr. Stewart expressed his frustration over the bill, which remains stalled despite broad support in the House and Senate.  “Don’t worry,” Mr. Graham said. “We’ll get there. We’ll get there.”
