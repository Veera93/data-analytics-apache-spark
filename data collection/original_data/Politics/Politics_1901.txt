 Republican presidential candidates watched Tuesday night’s Democratic debate from afar, and the general consensus was that Hillary Rodham Clinton got off too easy. Donald J. Trump, who offered instant analysis of the debate on Twitter, said on Wednesday morning that Senator Bernie Sanders made a mistake by brushing off Mrs. Clinton’s email controversy. “I think Bernie, actually, for the sake of a good soundbite, let her off the hook,” Mr. Trump said on MSNBC. “You have an F.B.I. investigation on the emails, and he just let her off.” Beyond that, Mr. Trump said he thought that Mrs. Clinton did well in the debate, which he said was generally a boring affair. “It wasn’t a very exciting debate,” he said. Jeb Bush, the former governor of Florida, issued Mrs. Clinton a warning that if they both end up being nominated by their parties he would be harder on her. “I thought it was interesting that he didn’t go after her, particularly on the email issue,” Mr. Bush told Fox News. “If she wins the nomination and I win the nomination, trust me, this is not going to end.” That sentiment was echoed by Senator Marco Rubio of Florida, who argued that Democrats were wrong if they think that Mrs. Clinton’s use of a private email server when she was secretary of state was no big deal. “Well, they may not care about it, but the people in this country do because it goes right to he issue of credibility,” Mr. Rubio said, also on Fox. Other Republicans also took to social media during the debate, sharing a taste of what they would tell Mrs. Clinton if they had the chance to be onstage with her. Former Gov. Mike Huckabee of Arkansas suggested that she was evading the truth and that she put the country at risk. — Gov. Mike Huckabee (@GovMikeHuckabee) October 14, 2015
