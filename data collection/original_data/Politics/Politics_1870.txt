 Senator Marco Rubio of Florida will take a detour on Friday from the typical Iowa-New Hampshire-South Carolina-Nevada circuit to visit Salem, Ohio, outside Youngstown, where he plans to give a detailed overview of his energy policy. Rising in the polls and getting a new look from big Republican donors, Mr. Rubio has been using the weeks after his widely praised performance at the last debate to build a higher profile. And occasionally that means taking a few jabs at his rivals.  On Thursday, after the news that the Jeb Bush campaign had only $10.3 million in the bank at the end of September, Mr. Rubio’s campaign issued a gleeful news release pointing out it had more. It wasn’t much more — the campaign had $11 million — but that didn’t stop it from boasting about its good sense and frugality: Uber X trips, flights on Frontier and Spirit, furniture from Craigslist. That the speech on Friday will take place in the home state of John R. Kasich, the Ohio governor who is also running for president, is hardly coincidental.
