 Hillary Clinton will head to upstate New York on Friday, armed with a dossier of data points and testimonials from her years as a senator, and with a $10 billion proposal to bolster jobs in manufacturing. The plan for manufacturing, which she will unveil at a round-table discussion at the Institute of Technology at Syracuse Central, invests in “Make It in America” partnerships that aim to encourage companies to spend on United States workers. Mrs. Clinton plans to pay for the lift to the manufacturing sector with her recently released “claw back” proposal, which would strip corporations of tax benefits if they move jobs overseas. The plan, and the timing of its rollout before the April 19 primaries in New York, highlights a period in the campaign during which aides say they can draw on Mrs. Clinton’s record as a senator, when she worked to bolster economically depressed regions of the state. “We fundamentally believe her work in upstate New York really represents a blueprint or road map for people to follow in looking at what she will do as president in terms of creating good-paying jobs,” Mrs. Clinton’s policy director, Jake Sullivan, told reporters.  Mr. Sullivan said Mrs. Clinton, who campaigned in Harlem and in Westchester this week, will be spending more time upstate, where she had previously worked to win over white, working-class voters in places like Buffalo and Rochester when making the transition to senate candidate from former first lady.  Polls have narrowed in Mrs. Clinton’s adopted home state as her opponent, Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, tries to pull off an unexpected win. Mrs. Clinton plans to present many of the people she worked with in the senate to talk about her record in the senate, including Karen St. Hilaire, a former St. Laurence County administrator who worked with Mrs. Clinton to help small businesses upstate sell their wares on eBay.
