 In New Hampshire, Gov. Chris Christie felt the full force of the “super PAC” supporting Senator Marco Rubio: It ran two negative television ads, printed mailers, made digital display ads and ran two separate websites against Mr. Christie that meshed with the broadcast ads. Now, the PAC, Conservative Solutions, is rolling out a similar playbook across Super Tuesday states and beyond against the candidate Mr. Rubio is aggressively targeting on the campaign trail: Donald J. Trump. It has produced two broadcast ads, running currently in Florida, accusing Mr. Trump of “knowing nothing” about foreign policy, and taking apart his business record. It has created companion websites, trumpknowsnothing.com and trumpwontfoolus.com, to go with the ads. It has also created targeted digital ads, with similar themes, that will lead voters to click onto one of the two sites. And it has gone to Snapchat, starting the first statewide geofilter campaign in Virginia by a super PAC, with slightly more aggressive messages that will pop up on smartphones in the state that use the app. “Trump is a Con Artist” reads one, with another saying “This pic is all you get for $35,000 at Trump University,” a reference to complaints from former students that they were ripped off by the company. It’s all part of a campaign to take down Mr. Trump, the Republican front-runner, that started on Thursday, the day Mr. Rubio aggressively went at Mr. Trump on the debate stage. The rhetoric spilled onto the campaign trail, as the insults only grew. The super PAC expects to keep up the anti-Trump digital efforts through Super Tuesday.
