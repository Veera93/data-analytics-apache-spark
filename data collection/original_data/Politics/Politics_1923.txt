 For Gov. Chris Christie, it has been a battle as challenging as facing off with New Jersey Democrats or cleaning up hurricane destruction. But on Friday, Mr. Christie said that, for the most part, he had won the struggle to control his weight. “It’s been really good for me,” Mr. Christie said on Fox News Radio. “I feel really good, but more than anything else, a peace of mind for me and for my family that my health is right where it needs to be.” The New Jersey governor and Republican presidential candidate had Lap-Band surgery in 2013 to help him shed weight. A year ago he told a group of donors that he had lost 85 pounds after the procedure, which reduces appetite by constricting the stomach.  On Friday, Mr. Christie said that he was not in a rush to lose much more weight at this point and was focused on maintaining his progress.  “For me now it’s about keeping it off,” he said. “To not feel the stress any longer, feeling like you have such a big mountain to climb, is a good thing.” While Mr. Christie is enjoying feeling healthier on the campaign trail this year, his weight has been a political issue in the past. In Mr. Christie’s 2008 race against Gov. John S. Corzine, Mr. Corzine ran an attack ad against Mr. Christie suggesting that he was “throwing his weight around” to avoid getting traffic tickets. The spot included unflattering images of a portly Mr. Christie wobbling out of a vehicle.  Mr. Christie said at the time that controlling his weight had been one of the most difficult challenges he had faced. Now, he said, he is happy to be an inspiration for others.  “People across this country understand what a struggle this is for so many Americans, and so if my experience provides them with any encouragement, that’s a great thing,” Mr. Christie said.
