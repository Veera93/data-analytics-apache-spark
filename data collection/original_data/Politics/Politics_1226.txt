 Donald J. Trump will speak at a Jan. 18 convocation at Liberty University, the conservative school that has been a stop for several presidential candidates this campaign cycle, and the place where Senator Ted Cruz kicked off his campaign. The stop at the university was listed on Mr. Trump’s schedule, released by his campaign on Tuesday, which also included visits to Vermont, Iowa, Nevada and South Carolina. The real-estate developer and national poll leader for most of the last six months is fending off a challenge in Iowa from Mr. Cruz, the Texas senator who has taken over the polling lead there and become the prohibitive favorite to win the first nominating contest, on Feb. 1. Mr. Cruz announced his candidacy at the end of March at Liberty, giving him a conservative audience at a university where convocation attendance is mandatory. The school, in Lynchburg, Va., was founded by the Rev. Jerry Falwell. His son, Jerry Falwell Jr., told The Lynchburg News and Advance this week that the Republican National Committee had approached Liberty about hosting a candidates’ forum and that several candidates agreed. Mr. Trump’s campaign said he would rather appear alone, according to Mr. Falwell. Mr. Trump appeared at Liberty in 2012 and has kept in contact with Mr. Falwell, according to his interview with the paper. Senator Bernie Sanders, the independent from Vermont who is running in the Democratic presidential primary, also spoke at Liberty in September.
