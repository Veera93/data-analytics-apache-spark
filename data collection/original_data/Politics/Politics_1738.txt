 Senator Ted Cruz of Texas has been aggressively fund-raising online after his standout performance in the debate. And it’s paid off: Mr. Cruz raised $1.1 million in the 24 hours that followed. Like many other candidates, he has a “super PAC” supporting him, Make DC Listen, which is also helping to capitalize on the momentum. The group sent out an email Thursday morning calling for donations. “The Cruz for President campaign will get 100% of your donation because Make DC Listen covers all the processing costs and fees,” the email read between links to a donation app. But trying to raise money for Mr. Cruz is easier when you have the candidate’s name. So the super PAC employed some tried-and-true tactics of email marketing campaigns. First, the email display in inboxes was from “Cruz for America,” a group that does not exist. Mr. Cruz’s campaign is “Ted Cruz for President,” and Federal Election Commission rules prohibit super PACs from having the name of the candidate they are supporting in their title, hence something bland like Make DC Listen. Yet that applies only to their commission filings and official titles. On email displays, they can call themselves whatever they want. So they went with Cruz for America. The email also did not come from a makedclisten.com address. It came from email@conservativeintel.com. The super PAC is most likely renting the list from Conservative Intel, a popular blog that has a large email list. Many outside groups will do this, hoping to grow their universe to solicit donations from people who probably shares views and values with Mr. Cruz, but who might not be on their email list.
