 OMAHA — Donald J. Trump took his general election campaign to an airplane hangar in Nebraska on Friday, and early on attempted to strike a chord not often found during his primary fight: reconciliation. It didn’t exactly come naturally. He was introduced and endorsed by Gov. Pete Ricketts, whose family bankrolled Our Principles PAC, one of the most aggressive anti-Trump “super PACs.” “What a great guy he is,” Mr. Trump said as he took the lectern from Mr. Ricketts. “Thank you, governor.” But later, he found himself joking about negative advertising with Mr. Ricketts, recalling the “60,000 negative ads” that hit Mr. Trump, and told Mr. Ricketts he would have been undone had he faced the barrage of attack ads that Mr. Trump did. Mr. Trump spoke about Rick Perry, the former Texas governor and presidential candidate who gave a full-throated endorsement of him on Thursday, just 10 months after giving a full-throated takedown of Mr. Trump. Mr. Trump welcomed Mr. Perry’s endorsement, but made sure to recall Mr. Perry’s past position. “So yesterday, he endorsed me, and I like him,” Mr. Trump said. “I’ll forget about the one hour when he went wild.” And for those who have been openly and recently critical of the candidate, Mr. Trump was ready with a counterpunch.  Senator Lindsey Graham was “nasty” and his own presidential campaign was “a disgrace.” Jeb Bush was, of course, “low energy.” Mr. Trump was more tepid in his mention of Paul Ryan, the House speaker, simply saying he was “surprised” about Mr. Ryan’s statement that he wasn’t ready to endorse Mr. Trump.    He was also able to show some restraint regarding an old foe, Senator Marco Rubio of Florida. “I like Marco,” he said. “I like everyone once it’s over. I like people.”
