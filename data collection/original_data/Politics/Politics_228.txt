 The House may be a tad light on the legislative front these days, largely focusing on bills like those that target the Internal Revenue Service and that have no chance of being signed by President Obama. But on the message front, Speaker Paul D. Ryan is keeping busy. Mr. Ryan, who plans to roll out a policy platform this spring, has already been trying to build a social media and youth movement around the House Republican agenda. This week, Mr. Ryan will participate in a town-hall-style event at the Georgetown Institute of Politics and Public Service. In advance of that event, his office has rolled out its latest video holding up Mr. Ryan as a man with a plan, though the details of that plan, obliquely intended to distract from the presidential campaign of Donald J. Trump, are very much a work in progress.  While Mr. Ryan has repeatedly said that he has no intention of becoming his partyâ€™s nominee this year, he has been busy creating a personality and policy alternative to run alongside the presidential effort to provide both a platform for House Republicans to run on and a foundation to rebuild if Republicans fall apart in November. Mr. Ryan is not a candidate. But his videos continue to make it seem as if he is running for something.
