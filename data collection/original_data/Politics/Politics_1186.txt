 Ted Cruz is on a six-day, 28-town swing through Iowa. These are the places, faces and culinary selections of 2016’s first proper bus tour. EVENT 24 Time: 10:05 a.m., Jan. 9 Place: Rossville, Iowa (population: unincorporated, though a campaign staff member placed it in the dozens) Site: “Old” Rossville Store, a tavern with a brown trout jutting from the wall and at least two images of an elk being shot by an arrow Mood: blearily caffeinating Instructions: “Don’t forget my coffee,” Mr. Cruz told an aide, quietly and politely, between post-speech handshakes. Well-traveled friend: “You generally don’t know what day it is,” said Mr. Cruz’s wife, Heidi, who arrived for the final day of the Iowa swing after campaigning for her husband in New Hampshire this week. Well-traveled foe: A representative for a pro-ethanol group, which has been tailing (and dogging) Mr. Cruz all week, yawned deeply as he handed out pamphlets. Highlight: Mr. Cruz did not quite promise he would never golf as president. But he suggested he would not golf well. “Do I golf?” Mr. Cruz said, repeating the question. “Horribly. And indeed, to call what I do golf — I do own clubs and I occasionally whack them into the ground and dig holes. But I think golf involves actually making contact with the ball and sending it in the direction of the hole, so by that definition, no, I don’t golf.”
