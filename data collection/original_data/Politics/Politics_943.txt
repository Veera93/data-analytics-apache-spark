 It’s a familiar way of donating, mastered by the Red Cross during global catastrophes: Simply text a five-digit number and a donation is made seamlessly through a phone bill. And now the method is coming to the Sanders campaign. Through the campaign’s digital vendor, Revolution Messaging, supporters of Mr. Sanders can now text the word “Give” to a special number and automatically donate $10.  There are federal caps to the donations that users can send. Individual phone numbers are allowed to donate $50 a month, topping out at $200 a year. But the Sanders digital team believes that the limits won’t affect them, pointing to their large universe of small-dollar donors that have been powering their campaign. The current average donation  is $27. “By putting the power in the hands of the ordinary citizens that text in 10 bucks, instead of billionaires wasting time and money at cocktail parties, we are changing the campaign finance playbook with Bernie Sanders and his supporters,” Scott Goodstein, the chief executive of Revolution Messaging, said in a statement. The Sanders campaign had been experimenting with text-to-donate applications before. It recently started a program integrated with ActBlue, but that only works for mobile subscribers who are also signed up with ActBlue Express, and it bills a credit card. This new technology can be used by anyone with a cellphone. Texting has struggled to catch on in political campaigns as a money source, but it has never had the ease of donations that this new technology brings. The method has been extremely successful for groups like the Red Cross to raise huge sums of money quickly.  The Sanders campaign has recently been targeting their fund-raising advertising with a request to help it get over three million donations by Monday, caucus day in Iowa.
