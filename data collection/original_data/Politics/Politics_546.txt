 Hillary Clinton is leading Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont in Florida and Ohio, according to polls released on Wednesday that show him looking vulnerable going into next week’s primary contests. Losses in Ohio and Florida, where there are a combined 405 delegates at stake on March 15, could deal a significant blow to Mr. Sanders’s campaign and increase pressure on him to consider dropping out of the race. A survey from Quinnipiac University shows Mrs. Clinton, the former secretary of state, dwarfing Mr. Sanders in Florida, with Democratic voters backing her by a margin of 62 percent to 32 percent. Mrs. Clinton leads Mr. Sanders with most groups in Florida, and she is even tied with him among young voters, a demographic that has generally been favoring him. “With less than a week until the actual voting, it is difficult to see a path to victory for him in the Sunshine State,” said Peter Brown, assistant director of the Quinnipiac University poll. “He just has too much ground to make up and not enough time in which to do it.” Despite the deep deficit in Florida, Mr. Sanders still stands a chance in Ohio, where he trails Mrs. Clinton 52 percent to 43 percent, according to a separate Quinnipiac poll. Very liberal voters, younger voters and men are keeping Mr. Sanders afloat there. The polls had margins of error of plus or minus four percentage points.
