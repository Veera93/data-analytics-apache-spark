 Less than two months ago, Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina said that deciding between Donald J. Trump and Senator Ted Cruz of Texas amounted to selecting whether to be “shot or poisoned.” He has made his choice. Mr. Graham, who recently joked about murdering Mr. Cruz on the Senate floor, plans to attend a fund-raiser on Monday in Washington as a special guest of the Cruz campaign. The event, tied to a gathering of the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, known as Aipac, is held “to honor and support a great friend of Israel and the Jewish people, and the next president of the United States, Ted Cruz,” according to an invitation. In a statement, Mr. Graham called his colleague “the best alternative to Donald Trump.” In recent weeks, Mr. Graham, who supported Jeb Bush for president, has signaled an openness to Mr. Cruz’s campaign, if a bit grudgingly. In an interview with NBC’s “Meet the Press” earlier this month, he summed up the dim view many establishment Republicans have of their remaining options. “Some hope with Ted,” he said, “no hope with Donald.” Mr. Graham said in an interview Thursday that though he planned to raise money on behalf of Mr. Cruz, he likes John Kasich. “But he doesn’t have the path that Ted does in terms of stopping Trump, which is the most important thing,” he said, referring to Mr. Kasich. Mr. Graham conceded that he has been strikingly critical of Mr. Cruz but that his desire to halt Mr. Trump’s momentum took precedent. “Having said that, it pales in comparison with my differences with Trump,” Mr. Graham said. “I think Ted Cruz is a reliable Republican, strong on Israel, will repeal and replace Obamacare, will be good on the Supreme Court. So we have many things in common, but we also have many differences.”
