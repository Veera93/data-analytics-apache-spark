 Speaker Paul D. Ryan may have stolen “Movember.” Mr. Ryan, the Wisconsin Republican, returned from his Thanksgiving break with some serious stubble, prompting questions of whether he was participating in the annual fund-raiser in which men ditch their razors in November. Proud of his furry face, Mr. Ryan wondered on social media whether he was, in fact, the first bearded House speaker in a century. While it was has not quite been 100 years, Mr. Ryan was close. According to the House historian, the last speaker with a beard was the appropriately named Frederick H. Gillett, who presided over the chamber until 1925. Politicians have generally preferred to be fresh-faced for much of the last century. However, as historians have noted, that was not always the case. The House’s History, Art and Archives department dug into the subject in 2013 and found that Speaker Thomas B. Reed, Republican of Maine, garnered headlines in The Boston Daily Globe, thanks to two weeks’ worth of growth on his upper lip. In November 1895, the newspaper characterized his mustache as a “trifle fuller than before and somewhat longer, with a downward curve that promises to give his smile more the general appearance of a sneer.” But the look did not last, and Mr. Reed showed up for work cleanshaven the next month. On Monday, Mr. Ryan’s beard drew mixed reviews online, with some suggesting it was little more than five o’clock shadow and others urging him to let it grow. A spokeswoman for Mr. Ryan said that the beard was not a Movember move, but was actually a remnant of a weekend “deer camp.” As for its permanence, it seems that one constituent will have the deciding vote. “He’ll keep it as long as Janna lets him,” she said, referring to Mr. Ryan’s wife.
