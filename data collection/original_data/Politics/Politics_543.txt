 MIAMI — Carly Fiorina endorsed Senator Ted Cruz of Texas on Wednesday, supplying his campaign with a high-profile supporter and an eager critic of Donald J. Trump. Mrs. Fiorina, the former presidential candidate and Hewlett-Packard chief executive, took to the role quickly, appearing as a surprise guest at Mr. Cruz’s morning rally in Florida. “Some people are now saying: ‘Well, Donald Trump wouldn’t’ be so bad. O.K., maybe he’s a liberal, maybe he’s a fraud but at least he’s a deal-maker,'” Mrs. Fiorina told a crowd of about 200 people. “The truth is that Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton are two sides of the same coin. They aren’t going to reform the system. They are the system.” For Mr. Cruz, who has increasingly moved to frame the primary season as a two-man race against Mr. Trump, the endorsement provides a crucial boost. “Our message today is one of unity,” he said after Mrs. Fiorina — who suspended her campaign after the New Hampshire primary in February — spent several minutes praising him. He surmised that, as news of the endorsement spread, “We just heard a whole bunch of Democratic activists and Hillary supporters go, ‘Whoa, what was that?’” Mrs. Fiorina’s history as a vocal critic of both Hillary Clinton and Mr. Trump leaves her well-positioned to act as a major Cruz surrogate. Few candidates have been as successful as Mrs. Fiorina in knocking Mr. Trump off balance during debates. In her first act as a Cruz supporter, Mrs. Fiorina even managed to praise the senator using a favored Trump phrase. “He has won over and over and over,” Mrs. Fiorina said of Mr. Cruz. “He has won.”
