 Senator Mitch McConnell, in making his case against Judge Merrick B. Garland, has noted that Judge Garland is opposed by the National Federation of Independent Business and that the small-business lobbying group has never before inserted itself in a high-profile court fight.  The point Mr. McConnell, the Kentucky Republican and majority leader, is trying to make is that Judge Garland’s record is so egregious that even a normally reserved lobbying group is taking on the nominee. But there is another reason as well.  The 325,000-member group, known universally as the N.F.I.B., has a new president, Juanita Duggan, and the Garland fight is providing an opportunity to showcase an aggressive posture for the lobbying organization and for her to establish herself.  “We can’t sit this one out,” Ms. Duggan, the former head of the American Apparel and Footwear Association, said when the nomination was announced.  Federation officials say that Judge Garland’s record in finding for regulators over businesses might have spurred the organization regardless, but that Ms. Duggan’s taking the reins last month eliminated any question about whether it would jump in. The group is a plaintiff in two challenges to the Environmental Protection Agency on water and energy regulations moving through the courts. The organization is expected to have much more to say about Judge Garland as the Senate impasse over his nomination continues.
