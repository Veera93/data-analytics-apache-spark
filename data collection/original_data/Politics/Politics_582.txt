 Donald J. Trump is dropping close to $1 million apiece in Ohio and Florida for television ads, two people tracking media spending said, in a signal that the sustained advertising assault against him is taking a toll.  Mr. Trump, who has talked about his psychological need to watch his costs as a businessman and who has bemoaned having to spend on television ads at all, made the ad reservations in the last two days. Florida and Ohio hold its primaries on March 15. The states are home to two of his rivals, Gov. John Kasich of Ohio and Senator Marco Rubio of Florida, and a home-state loss for either could knock them out of the presidential race.  But more significant, Mr. Trump is on the receiving end of attack ads in Florida that are highlighting a class-action suit against Trump University, his defunct program of real estate seminars, by more than 5,000 former students who say they were cheated out of money.  Among the groups airing ads focusing on Trump University are the American Future Fund and Our Principles PAC, which was founded by Katie Packer, a former adviser to Mitt Romney, the Republican presidential nominee in 2012. A member of the influential Ricketts family seeded the group with an early investment of $3 million. Other donors have since stepped in.  On a conference call with donors last week, Brian Baker, an adviser to the Ricketts family, walked people through the delegate math and said that funding ads against Mr. Trump was a crucial endeavor. “Americans’ frustrations and anger are real, and justified, but Donald Trump is not the answer,” Mr. Baker said in a statement. “His lack of principle when it comes to policy, and his divisive rhetoric, neither unites nor inspires our party — or our country. We will educate voters about Trump’s real record, because we deserve better.”  Mr. Trump has denounced groups spending money against him as evidence of special interests and a corrupt culture working against him.
