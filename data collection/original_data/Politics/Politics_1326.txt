 NASHVILLE — The pastor looked out over the hundreds gathered here at a faith-based skate park, imploring them to follow. Most were strangers. Two knew him well. “I want all of you to spread your hands out,” the minister, Gaylon Wiley, said. “We’re going to lay hands on Ted Cruz.” The guests raised their hands, and for a few moments, Mr. Cruz grew quiet. The rally, he said finally, had become “part prayer revival.” This is not uncommon at a Cruz campaign event. But Tuesday’s fare was something different. Mr. Wiley, Mr. Cruz explained, first came into the Cruz family’s life in 1975. Mr. Cruz’s father, Rafael, who introduced the Texas senator on Tuesday, had abandoned his wife and son in Canada. Rafael traveled to Houston, the senator said, repeating a tale central to his biography in public life. It was there that Rafael Cruz went to a Bible study and met Mr. Wiley, who now lives in Tennessee. (Mr. Cruz said he saw him for the first time in decades at a campaign event over the summer.) “My father began asking him questions,” Mr. Cruz said. “My father was young, he was smart, he was a scientist, he was an atheist. He was certain he knew everything. And he argued until 11 o’clock at night.” At one point in their chat, Rafael Cruz asked the pastor how he could reconcile his views on faith with the fact that there is a “man in Tibet who’s never heard of Jesus.” “I don’t know about the man in Tibet,” Mr. Wiley replied, according to the younger Mr. Cruz. “But you’ve heard of Jesus, what’s your excuse?” “And he dropped to his knees,” the candidate said of his father, “and he gave his life to Jesus.” Mr. Cruz’s father returned to his family. Years later, his son was baptized — by Mr. Wiley.
