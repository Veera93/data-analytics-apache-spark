 Ted Cruz is on a six-day, 28-town swing through Iowa. These are the places, faces and culinary selections of 2016’s first proper bus tour. EVENT 19 Time: 12:40 p.m. Place: Manly, Iowa (population: 1,323) Site: Casey’s General Store, a convenience-store chain and semi-pizzeria Mood: Crowded aisles, large beverages Food: taco pizza, meat galore, wedgie fries Drinks, in a well-stocked wine display: ringneck red, autumn hush, peach be with you Repeat customer: Mr. Cruz approached a woman who said she had seen him speak before. “You’re a glutton for punishment,” he said. Service: Mr. Cruz, greeting workers behind the counter, offered to fetch some items. “Anyone need some gas? Gas? Powerball ticket? I recommend the Slushies, the Slushies are really good.” Highlight: It seems Mr. Cruz has been reading up. As he brushed past a New York Times reporter beside the register, he paused to comment on a detail in a post from Thursday night, when Mr. Cruz referred to the comedian Henny Youngman as “Benny.” “Henny? Benny? O.K.,” he said playfully. “You know what? It was before my time.” The reporter confessed that the fact-check had required an Internet search. “You had to look it up?” Mr. Cruz said with a grin.
