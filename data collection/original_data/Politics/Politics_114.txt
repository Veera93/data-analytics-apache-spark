 Donald J. Trump announced on Wednesday that Rick Wiley, whom he hired as his national political director six weeks ago, is no longer a part of the campaign. Mr. Wiley, who managed the 2016 presidential campaign of Gov. Scott Walker of Wisconsin and has deep ties to the Republican Party, was brought in by Paul Manafort, a top Trump adviser, to help streamline the campaign’s operations in Washington. But Mr. Wiley quickly clashed with state party officials — several of whom complained directly to Mr. Trump, according to an aide. Mr. Wiley did not immediately return messages on Wednesday evening seeking comment. Mr. Wiley also clashed with Karen Giorno, who ran Mr. Trump’s operations in Florida, where he defeated Senator Marco Rubio in his home-state primary by nearly 20 points. Earlier on Wednesday, before being let go entirely — news first reported by Politico — Mr. Wiley had been stripped of his role overseeing Florida, as Bloomberg News reported. “Rick Wiley was hired on a short-term basis as a consultant until the campaign was running full steam,” the Trump campaign said in a statement. “It is now doing better than ever, we are leading in the polls, and we have many exciting events ready to go, far ahead of schedule, while Hillary continues her long, boring quest against Bernie. We would like to thank Rick for helping us during this transition period.” Mr. Wiley was one of Mr. Manafort’s first hires, and his departure adds another wrinkle to the feud between Mr. Manafort and Corey Lewandowski, Mr. Trump’s campaign manager. Although the Trump campaign last week gave Mr. Manafort an elevated title, of campaign chairman and chief strategist, Mr. Wiley’s dismissal offers another sign that Mr. Lewandowski still holds sway within the Trump operation.
