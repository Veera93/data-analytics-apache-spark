 It’s becoming easier to see how the Republican race will shape up after the South Carolina primary on Saturday. It’s less clear how it will shake out.  The dueling town-hall-style forums on Wednesday night — one by MSNBC with just Donald J. Trump, the other by CNN with Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, Senator Marco Rubio of Florida and Ben Carson — were mere accents at the end of one of the most intense days of the Republican race. Mr. Trump and Mr. Cruz locked horns throughout the day over a cease-and-desist letter that Mr. Trump’s team sent to Mr. Cruz about a Cruz ad with a clip from 1999 in which Mr. Trump said he was “very pro-choice.” Mr. Trump has said that he has evolved on the issue, and that the spot doesn’t represent his current position.  Mr. Cruz announced that he would not pull the ad, daring Mr. Trump, who has threatened for days to file some form of suit against his rival, to do just that. That spat was capped by the surprise announcement that Gov. Nikki R. Haley, Republican of South Carolina, was endorsing Mr. Rubio, providing him with a potentially significant push in the final three days. That announcement was a blow to Jeb Bush, who seemed to be wearing disappointment at events during the day. Those four candidates all hope to finish in the top three slots in South Carolina. After Saturday, the race moves to territory that is more favorable to Gov. John R. Kasich of Ohio, with a string of contests in the Midwest. Mr. Rubio hopes to consolidate much of the vote to try to become the person who can sell himself to voters and donors as the man to stop Mr. Trump, who has run through the reeds of the Republican establishment with a machete in recent days. But Mr. Cruz has money and a case to make. And so the race will march on.
