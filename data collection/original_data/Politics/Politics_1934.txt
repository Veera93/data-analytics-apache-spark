 It was supposed to be the day in which they cleared the air. But after Donald J. Trump opted against sitting down for questions from the United States Hispanic Chamber of Commerce on Thursday, the billionaire developer’s relationship with Hispanic business leaders is at a new low. “It was a day we were going to call him to account for his rhetoric and his language,” said Javier Palomarez, president of the chamber. “As we all know now, he didn’t have the intestinal fortitude to show.” Mr. Trump had made an effort to smooth things over with the chamber when he invited Mr. Palomarez to his office In New York for a meeting in early September. While things seemed to go well, Mr. Palomarez said he has been frustrated that Mr. Trump’s tone toward Hispanics did not soften in the following weeks.  Confusion surfaced last week after the group announced that, like several other presidential candidates, Mr. Trump would be coming in for a public question-and-answer session hosted by the group. Mr. Trump denied that he ever agreed to do so, said that he would be in Las Vegas and that Mr. Palomarez asked him for money, which Mr. Palomarez says is a lie. What kinds of questions would Mr. Trump have faced? Mr. Palomarez said in an interview that he would have started off by asking him about the feasibility of building a giant wall along the Mexican border. Then he would have inquired about whether it was realistic or humane to deport more than 11 million people who are living in the United States and how this plan would affect the hospitality and construction sectors. Finally, Mr. Palomarez said, he wanted to know how Mr. Trump thought he would win any Hispanic support with such a plan. “I wanted substance,” Mr. Palomarez said. “I assume he didn’t have answers.”
