 The Clinton campaign has been dispatching a rotation of high-power surrogates to New Hampshire, most recently Lena Dunham and Abby Wambach. Next up: Chelsea Clinton. Hillary Clinton’s daughter will make her first campaign swing of 2016 with three events in New Hampshire, attending a round-table event on early childhood education in Concord, a grass-roots organizing event in Manchester and a Women for Hillary organizing event at the Portsmouth Brewery. The Clinton campaign has been trying to quell a rising threat from Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, in particular in New Hampshire. Robby Mook, the campaign manager, sent out a message to supporters last week with the subject line “nervous,” and spoke about Mr. Sanders outspending them in Iowa and New Hampshire. Amid this threat, Mrs. Clinton and her allies have been visiting New Hampshire frequently. The candidate herself was in Manchester to pick up the endorsement of Planned Parenthood on Sunday, and Bill Clinton made his campaign trail debut in Nashua and Exeter last week. The decision to involve Chelsea Clinton more in the campaign was reported in December, and she is also scheduled to head to Iowa this weekend.
