 COLUMBIA, S.C. — They looked “like a Benetton ad,” Gov. Nikki Haley said. She meant herself, the daughter of Sikh Indian immigrants; Senator Tim Scott, who is black; Representative Trey Gowdy, who is white; and Senator Marco Rubio, a Cuban-American. “What the new conservative movement looks like,” Ms. Haley beamed to an audience of several hundred people, who assembled in a hotel ballroom on Friday morning to see Mr. Rubio on his final day of campaigning before voting in the South Carolina Republican primary. If she is right, and a group of younger, more diverse Republicans can appeal to voters in November, it could save her party from being shut out of the White House for another four years.  That rationale — that Republicans will keep losing national elections unless they can appeal to nonwhite Americans who have been voting overwhelmingly against them — is an underpinning to Mr. Rubio’s presidential campaign.  Mr. Rubio’s pollster, Whit Ayers, was one of the first to recognize the undeniable demographic realities facing the next Republican nominee. And in his recent book “2016 and Beyond,” Mr. Ayres notes that any candidate will have a difficult time overcoming the math. If the Republican nominee in 2016 wins the same 59 percent share of the white vote that Mitt Romney won in 2012, he would have to win 30 percent of the nonwhite vote to become president. No Republican presidential candidate has done that in modern times.  Ms. Haley’s popularity in South Carolina, of course, was not the only reason that Mr. Rubio lobbied so hard for her endorsement, which she delivered on Wednesday.  Expect to see the image of the two of them together a lot if Mr. Rubio makes it to the general election — Mr. Rubio’s version of the famous United Colors of Benetton ads, which depicted racially diverse groups of people as part of the Italian retailer’s campaign to sell clothes.
