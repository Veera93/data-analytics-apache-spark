 With her lead against Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont slipping in Iowa, Hillary Clinton’s campaign on Tuesday unveiled a new television ad that sought to seize on President Obama’s popularity among Democratic voters on the issue of gun control. The ad, titled “I’m With Him,” shows Mrs. Clinton speaking into the camera and declaring her support for Mr. Obama’s measures to put into effect additional background checks and other gun control proposals. “An average of 90 people are killed in this country every single day. It has to stop,” Mrs. Clinton said in the ad scheduled to be broadcast during the State of the Union address in Iowa and New Hampshire.  “It’s time to pick a side,” she continued. “Either we stand with the gun lobby or we join the President and stand up to them. I’m with him.” Mrs. Clinton has stepped up her attacks on Mr. Sanders’s record on gun control measures in the senate, an issue her campaign believes will motivate primary voters and that aligns Mrs. Clinton with Mr. Obama who is widely popular among Democratic voters. The new ad does not mention Mr. Sanders but the implication is clear.  Earlier on Tuesday, in Ames, Iowa, the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence endorsed Mrs. Clinton.
