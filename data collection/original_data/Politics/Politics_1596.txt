 Well aware of the potential political dangers of getting crossways with public opinion on the Syrian refugee question, top Democrats responded cautiously on Tuesday but generally defended the program and highlighted its existing protections to keep terrorists from infiltrating the ranks of refugees. Senate Democratic leaders said they would withhold final judgment until a high-level classified briefing on Wednesday, open to all senators. Among those scheduled to conduct the briefing were the heads of the Department of Homeland Security, of the F.B.I. and of the National Counterterrorism Center along with top Pentagon, State Department and refugee program officials. “I don’t think at this stage we should be pausing until we get the facts,” said Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, the Democratic leader.  Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the No. 3 Democrat and a top party strategist, expressed his view a little differently, saying that “a pause may be necessary” but that Democrats were waiting for the briefing and more information. Mr. Reid indicated that one of the main jobs for Democrats would be to better convey the safeguards already in place. “Right now, it’s been established very clearly that for refugees, the vetting process is 18 to 24 months, and we’re going to take a look at that and see if that can be made any more clear to the members of the Senate and to the American public,” Mr. Reid said. In the House, where Democrats might face a vote this week on the program, Representative Nancy Pelosi of California, the party leader, noted that the refugees were subjected to “rigorous scrutiny and an intensive screening process.” “We can both welcome desperate, vulnerable families and ensure our own security,” she said.
