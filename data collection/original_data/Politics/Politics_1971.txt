 After months of name-calling, Jeb Bush and Donald J. Trump have finally found a name that they can agree on: the Washington Redskins. Last week, Mr. Bush weighed in on the long-running debate about whether the football team’s name should be changed out of respect for Native Americans. Speaking on SiriusXM’s POTUS channel, Mr. Bush said the Redskins should be left alone, saying “I don’t find it offensive.” Native American groups were angered, and Democrats called it another example of Mr. Bush’s insensitivity. But in this case, Mr. Trump says he thinks that Mr. Bush is right. “Honestly, I don’t think they should change the name, unless the owner wanted to,” Mr. Trump said in an interview. Mr. Trump. who has made bluntness a hallmark of his presidential bid, said that the Redskins moniker was yet another issue of unnecessary political correctness. The name has been that way for years, he said, and not everyone considers it to be a slur. “I know Indians that are extremely proud of that name,” he said. “They think it’s a positive.” Areas of agreement between Mr. Trump and Mr. Bush have been few since they became presidential candidates, often ridiculing each other on policy and personality. Asked if their shared view on the Redskins might help them turn over a new leaf, Mr. Trump said with a laugh, “It’s progress.”
