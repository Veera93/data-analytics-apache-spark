 MANCHESTER, N.H. — Donald J. Trump has brought his oh-so-New York swagger to New Hampshire, and some other Big Apple personalities have followed close behind, bringing their own tabloid touch to the tradition-bound first primary state. For a moment on Monday morning, the Best Western Plus Executive Court Inn and Conference Center in Manchester felt a bit like the Fifth Avenue lobby of Trump Tower. Reporters, photographers and gawkers waited for Mr. Trump to emerge in the foyer and among them was Marcia Kramer, the hard-charging veteran reporter for New York’s WCBS-TV.   Also present were a handful of Secret Service agents, who were straying a bit from doing protection and into the realm of corralling the news media. A collision was inevitable, and it was unlikely that Ms. Kramer would be denied.  But the way she did it was downright Trumpian, a vintage New York power move. “Could you let go of my breast, please?” Ms. Kramer demanded of an agent in a firm voice short of a yell but loud enough to be heard over the “Mr. Trump, Mr. Trump!” din. Ms. Kramer issued her demand the moment when Mr. Trump was headed in her direction and it prompted the agents to ease off her and the candidate to stop and, of course, take a series of questions. (“Jeb’s a stiff,” Mr. Trump said, among other insults.) Her quarry caught, Ms. Kramer seemed to express a bit of wonder that the two New Yorkers were here, him running for president. “We’ve known each other, like, forever,” she observed. “A long time,” he agreed. Then, right before he headed out the door and into his waiting S.U.V., he made clear to Ms. Kramer that he had heard her – and she ought not to hold it against him.  “This is U.S. government, not my guys, O.K.?” Mr. Trump said, nodding to his security detail.  “Have a good time!”
