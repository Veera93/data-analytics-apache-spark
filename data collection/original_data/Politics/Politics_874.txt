 The eyes of the political world are on New Hampshire, but the fallout from the Iowa caucuses is far from over. Following reports of mischief by the Cruz campaign and bungled vote-counting on the Democratic side, Iowans are feeling as if they fumbled their moment in the spotlight. The state’s governor, Terry Branstad, a Republican, suggested as much on Thursday when he criticized Senator Ted Cruz’s team for falsely telling caucusgoers that Ben Carson was dropping out of the race. Mr. Cruz, who won the caucuses, apologized to Mr. Carson, but there have been reports that the misinformation drained support from Mr. Carson, a retired neurosurgeon, as voters headed out to caucus. “You know, we have a strong sense of fairness in Iowa,” Mr. Branstad said in an interview with Radio Iowa. “Distributing information that was not true about a candidate right at the time people are voting in the caucuses is an inappropriate thing.” Meanwhile, The Des Moines Register, Iowa’s largest newspaper, lamented the handling of the Democrats’ race. Hillary Clinton narrowly edged out Senator Bernie Sanders, but in some precincts the outcomes were so close that they were decided by coin toss, and there have been questions about inconsistent vote counts. In an editorial, the newspaper called on the Iowa Democratic Party to assure the accuracy of the results. “What happened Monday night at the Democratic caucuses was a debacle, period,” the editorial argued. “Democracy, particularly at the local party level, can be slow, messy and obscure. But the refusal to undergo scrutiny or allow for an appeal reeks of autocracy.”
