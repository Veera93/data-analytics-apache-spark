 As book titles go, it’s not exactly a beacon of optimism. But like the presidential campaign of its author, “Crippled America,” a new book by Donald J. Trump, is deliberately defying convention. (Its subtitle is less doomsday: “How to Make America Great Again.”) The book is the latest entrant into a veritable library of literary offerings from this year’s presidential field, several of which have become best-sellers. There is “American Dreams” by Senator Marco Rubio of Florida, “Rising to the Challenge” by Carly Fiorina, and “A Time for Truth” by Senator Ted Cruz of Texas. Mr. Trump is by far the most prolific author in the Republican presidential contest, having written (with assistance) a raft of titles about finance and real estate since the 1980s. However, this is Mr. Trump’s first campaign book — aides say it’s a blueprint for a Trump administration — and he plans to make the most out of the obligatory publicity tour. He will hold a news conference and book signing at Trump Tower in Midtown Manhattan on Tuesday morning. The timing is auspicious: He has struggled to draw the kind of nonstop attention that his campaign once took for granted. At a recent campaign event in Iowa, Mr. Trump explained the logic behind the dour title, which is at odds with his campaign slogan “Make America Great Again.” Why not use that as a title? “Eh, it’s too nice, because our country’s in trouble,” Mr. Trump said at the time. “Then I was going to say ‘Greatness in America.’ Then I said, ‘It’s too nice.’”
