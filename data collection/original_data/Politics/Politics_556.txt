 Senate Republicans pounded Democrats for years for not producing a budget, but they are now finding out that it’s not that easy to do in a charged political environment. With the budget stalled in the House, Senator Michael B. Enzi, the Wyoming Republican who leads the Budget Committee, announced on Monday that his panel would be putting off any action on a budget for at least this month and probably beyond. Congress can get by without a formal budget this year since the overall spending levels for 2017 were set in a deal reached last December. But not coming to an agreement when Republicans control the House and the Senate will be an embarrassment, particularly since the leadership has been promising to restore “regular order.” Not to mention the fact that first-year Speaker Paul D. Ryan was once a celebrated Budget Committee chairman. It would also deny Republicans a chance to employ a special filibuster-proof procedure on legislation covering taxes and health care because the process can be initiated only through budget approval. However, passing a budget in the Senate would require members of both parties to cast a series of tough votes in the annual “vote-a-rama,” a marathon of dozens of consecutive votes when both sides try to make vulnerable incumbents take positions that the opposition can turn into political attacks.  If they can avoid that situation and still move forward with spending bills, Republicans fighting to hold the Senate in the November elections would probably rather punt on the budget altogether, even though it might draw some ridicule from Democrats.
