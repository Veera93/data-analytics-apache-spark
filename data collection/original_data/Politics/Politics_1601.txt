 Former President Bill Clinton will appear as the main attraction at a meeting on Dec. 1 with prospective donors to Priorities USA Action, the “super PAC” that is supporting his wife’s presidential campaign — the first such event he will do for the group.  Mr. Clinton’s appearance was featured on an invitation describing him as the “special guest” at the event in New York City that will also feature the group’s chief strategist, Guy Cecil.  The appearance is a potential new phase for Priorities, which has been trying to ramp up its fund-raising as a bumper crop of super PACs has sprouted up on the Republican side of the race. Mr. Clinton raised money in 2012 for Priorities when it was supporting President Obama’s re-election effort.  Mr. Clinton’s skills as a fund-raiser have been seen as an enormous potential asset to the candidacy of his wife, Hillary Rodham Clinton.
