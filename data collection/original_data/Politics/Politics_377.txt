 Donald J. Trump and Hillary Clinton may be facing uphill battles against their rivals in Wisconsin’s primary election on Tuesday, but the contest later this month in New York, where they both have roots, should prove to be friendlier turf. A new poll from Quinnipiac University released on Thursday found Mr. Trump leading in New York, with 56 percent of Republican voters supporting him, 20 percent backing Senator Ted Cruz of Texas and 19 percent backing Gov. John Kasich of Ohio. The Manhattan businessman leads among men, women and Republicans of all ages. On the Democratic side, Mrs. Clinton leads Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont by a margin of 54 percent to 42 percent. Mrs. Clinton does best among women and older voters, while Mr. Sanders, who was born in Brooklyn beats her among men and with “very liberal” voters. “Donald Trump, whose name is emblazoned all over New York City buildings, trounces the other two Republicans, while Hillary Clinton, the adopted daughter from Chappaqua, leads Sanders in double digits on the Democratic side,” said Maurice Carroll, assistant director of Quinnipiac’s poll. As with many national and state polls, Mrs. Clinton beats Mr. Trump handily in a hypothetical head-to-head matchup. She also tops Mr. Cruz, and would face a closer contest against Mr. Kasich. The poll has a margin of error of plus or minus five percentage points for Republicans and four points for Democrats. New York holds its primary election on April 19.
