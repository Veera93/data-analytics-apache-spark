 President Obama will join an international push for a new climate change accord in Paris on Monday at a summit meeting that is part environmental conference and part demonstration by world powers that they will not be deterred by terrorism. In the aftermath of the Nov. 13 attacks in Paris, nations participating in the conference quickly decided that the long-scheduled meetings would go forward as a show of defiance and a statement that acts of terrorism cannot disrupt government business. To reinforce the point and to pay his respects, Mr. Obama made an unannounced stop upon arriving in Paris at the Bataclan concert hall, a site of the terrorist attacks. He left a rose and observed a moment of silence. Attending with 150 other world leaders, Mr. Obama is set to remain in France until Tuesday, taking part in the climate talks he considers a major part of his agenda. On Monday, he is also scheduled to meet with the heads of China and India and hold a news conference. The talks among the negotiators will continue toward a Dec. 11 deadline. In Washington, congressional Republicans have drawn a line against the president’s climate initiatives, and the House is scheduled to vote this week on legislation that would undo new Environmental Protection Agency rules on power-plant emissions — a major element of the administration’s efforts to address climate change. The legislation is unlikely to become law, but Republicans hope it shows the international climate negotiators that the nation is not united politically behind the president’s proposals.
