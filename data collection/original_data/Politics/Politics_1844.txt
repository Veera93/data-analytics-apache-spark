 The Senate is scheduled on Tuesday to vote on whether to take up a measure that would deny federal law enforcement funds to so-called sanctuary cities — hundreds of communities where the authorities don’t automatically seek deportation of undocumented immigrants who come to their attention.  Democrats intend to block the measure, which got new attention after a case in San Francisco in July where a deportee with a felony record who repeatedly re-entered the country was accused of murdering a young woman. The measure is sponsored by Senator David Vitter, the Louisiana Republican running for governor back home. Democrats and immigration activists have attacked the measure as a flawed response to an immigration crisis that calls for a much more comprehensive approach. Some Republicans have expressed doubts about it as well. The bill would also impose new five-year mandatory minimum jail sentences on those who return after being convicted of a felony or who are twice convicted of illegally entering the country. The proposed new sentences come as a bipartisan coalition of senators is trying to undo a broad set of existing mandatory minimum sentences as part of a new criminal justice package.  Backers of the criminal justice legislation hope that by giving Republican senators a chance to record a tough-on-crime vote for the sanctuary cities measure, it will clear the way for them to support the separate criminal justice overhaul that would reduce jail time for nonviolent offenders.
