 A string of allied “super PACs” supporting the presidential campaign of Senator Ted Cruz of Texas is planning a $1 million television, digital and radio advertising buy in the early voting states, with the heaviest spending in Iowa, a spokeswoman for the group said.  The super PACs, both collectively and individually called Keep the Promise, are flush with cash, and this spending is the biggest investment in television advertising that any of them have made this year.  The ad buy includes television advertising in Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada and South Carolina. By midday Thursday, $700,000 was reserved for television time in Iowa, according to a person at a firm that tracks media spending.  Officials with the group would not say what type of ads would be aired or whether they would be positive about Mr. Cruz or negative about other candidates.  Super PACs pay much higher rates for advertising than candidates do, so the amount of airtime that the $1 million will go toward is far less than what campaigns can get. But candidates have typically relied on these outside groups to focus on attacking rivals.
