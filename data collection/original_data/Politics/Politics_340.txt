 President Obama will join Chris Wallace on “Fox News Sunday” this weekend for a televised interview from Chicago. It is the first time that he will be on “Fox News Sunday” since being elected president. He was last on the program in 2008, when he was a United States senator from Illinois. The president has been a rare guest on the network, but he hasn’t completely ignored it throughout his tenure. In 2013, he sat for an interview with Mr. Wallace, with a focus on the situation in Syria. And last year, he did an interview with Bill O’Reilly during the Super Bowl coverage. A news release from Fox News said the interview topics will include the battle over Merrick Garland’s Supreme Court nomination, the presidential election and Mr. Obama’s legacy. The interview will be broadcast on the Fox broadcast networks, with replays on the Fox News cable channel at 2 p.m. and 6 p.m. Eastern time.
