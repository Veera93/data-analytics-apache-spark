 GREENVILLE, S.C. — An audience member at a rally for Senator Marco Rubio called Hillary Clinton “a traitor,” prompting an objection from the candidate. “I wouldn’t go that far, sir,” Mr. Rubio said from the stage where he was campaigning with Gov. Nikki Haley, who stood by his side.  It was the kind of confrontation that presidential candidates must carefully navigate — tamping down potentially offensive statements from voters without offending energetic supporters. And it arrived just a few days after a similar moment, when Mr. Rubio did not object to a voter at a different campaign event in South Carolina, who suggested that Mrs. Clinton should be subjected to torture.  “Let’s waterboard Hillary!” the audience member shouted. At the time, Mr. Rubio playfully noted that the news media was in the room but said he did not hear what the man had said, drawing laughs from the crowd. As he campaigns for president, Mr. Rubio routinely says that Mrs. Clinton is disqualified from serving as president because of her conduct in the past, such as relying on a private email server and her handling of the attacks on the United State consulate in Benghazi, Libya.  It was at that moment on Thursday that the man in the audience yelled out that Mrs. Clinton was a traitor. When Mr. Rubio objected, the man who had shouted about Mrs. Clinton sought to elaborate. He mentioned Benghazi. Mr. Rubio addressed the attack on the consulate but quickly moved on from the subject.
