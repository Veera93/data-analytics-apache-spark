 After a seven-week break, Congress returns on Tuesday for a pre-election session that is likely to produce substantial political positioning without much substantive accomplishment. Republicans do not seem inclined to try anything bold to shake up the election landscape, despite concerns that the presidential candidacy of Donald J. Trump is threatening their control of the Senate, and to a lesser degree, the House. They do seem to want to put Democrats on the spot over the Obama administration’s payment of $400 million in cash to the Iranian government in January, however, and they plan to vote on legislation regarding the exchange, and to convene a committee hearing to explore the circumstances of the payment. The chief thing that Congress must do is find a way to fund the government after the end of the fiscal year on Sept. 30, since the House and Senate again failed to advance the annual spending bills. That legislation is also likely to include money to combat the Zika virus and possibly some relief funds for flooding in Louisiana, as lawmakers try to take advantage of one last opportunity to get their priorities enacted. As usual, the spending negotiations could get messy. Some Republicans would prefer to fund the government into next year to avoid a postelection, lame-duck session, while Democrats, anticipating a good election cycle, want to extend spending only into December. The dispute could raise the prospect of a government shutdown just weeks before the election on Nov. 8. But Senator Mitch McConnell, the Kentucky Republican and majority leader, has vowed to avoid such disruptions and would no doubt take steps to do so given the number of vulnerable Senate seats Republicans are defending. House Republicans had said that they would consider a series of criminal justice changes in September. No such proposals have been scheduled so far, however, as the party’s leaders in the House try to gauge the rank and file’s interest in proceeding.
