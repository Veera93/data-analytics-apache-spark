 Ted Cruz is on a six-day, 28-town swing through Iowa. These are the places, faces and culinary selections of 2016’s first proper bus tour. EVENT 8 Time: 6:56 p.m., Jan. 5 Place: Sioux Center, Iowa (population: 7,048) Site: Dordt College, in a cavernous student activity center Mood: zealous pre-semester orientation Travel opportunities (per signage): three-week program in Puerto Rico. Contact Professor Rikki Heldt. Subjects of questions for Mr. Cruz from attendees: undocumented immigrants; his opposition to subsidies supported by the ethanol industry; whether China or Russia poses a greater threat Highlight: Mr. Cruz almost certainly became the first presidential candidate to say, “I’m going to stick with Fonzie jumping the shark.” In his first somewhat fractious news conference this trip, Mr. Cruz repeatedly declined to address Donald J. Trump’s comments questioning the senator’s eligibility to be president. (Mr. Cruz was born in Canada.) His most substantive reply on Tuesday was, indeed, a tweet with a shark-jumping video clip from the show “Happy Days.” Mr. Cruz said he would let that stand.
