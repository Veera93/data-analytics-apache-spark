 George Soros, whose reputation for big-money giving has loomed larger than his actual checkbook in most recent election cycles, contributed $6 million in December to Priorities USA Action, a “super PAC” supporting Hillary Clinton’s presidential bid. The contribution, reported in the group’s Federal Election Commission disclosures on Sunday, brings Mr. Soros’s total super PAC giving for the 2016 cycle to more than $8 million. That is more than he contributed to such groups — which can accept unlimited funds — during the entire 2012 and 2014 political cycles, combined. The money signifies a return to form of sorts for Mr. Soros, who in 2004 contributed $18.5 million to outside groups seeking to elect Democrats and defeat President George W. Bush, making Mr. Soros a distinctively influential figure in liberal political projects.  His early spending, which failed to unseat Mr. Bush, seemed to sour Mr. Soros on similar projects. In recent years, his political spending, while generous by most standards, has been far more modest. He gave just $1 million to Priorities USA in 2012, when the group was supporting President Obama’s re-election campaign.
