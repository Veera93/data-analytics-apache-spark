 Asked during Wednesday’s debate to name his greatest weakness, Ben Carson decided to zig where some of his opponents zagged: He answered the question. “Probably in terms of the applying for the job of president, a weakness would be not really seeing myself in that position,” he began, “until hundreds of thousands of people began to tell me that I needed to do it.” On Thursday, before an event in Lakewood, Colo., Mr. Carson, a retired neurosurgeon, held forth on the life he had envisioned before political ambitions intervened. “I was planning on retiring,” he said, “not setting my alarm clock, reading all the books I’ve never read, watching the movies I haven’t seen, playing golf, learning how to play the organ. That’s what I envisioned. I did not envision being president of the United States.” Standing behind him, Mr. Carson’s wife, Candy, chimed in. “And I wanted my husband back,” she said to laughs. Asked if he saw himself differently now, Mr. Carson replied, “very much so.” “You know, things happen,” he said, in an apparent allusion to the groundswell of support. “And you respond to them.”
