 The Republican National Committee has canceled its partnership with NBC for a late February debate in Houston and is awarding the broadcast to CNN. The decision comes after many Republicans, including Reince Priebus, the committee chairman, were dissatisfied with CNBC’s handling of the third Republican debate in October. “The Republican National Committee has decided to move forward without NBC’s participation in the February debate in Houston,” Mr. Priebus said in a statement, adding that the date of the event would be moved up a day, to Feb. 25 from Feb. 26, and that “the partnership with Telemundo and conservative partners National Review and Salem Communications will continue as planned.” The Houston debate will come a few days before 12 states head to the polls or caucuses for Super Tuesday on March 1. Shortly after the October debate, Mr. Priebus sent a letter to NBC officials suspending the partnership, which put the Houston debate partnership in jeopardy. Mr. Priebus wrote then that CNBC’s “handling of the debate was conducted in bad faith,” saying that “questions were inaccurate or downright offensive.” NBC officials did not immediately respond to requests for comment on Monday.
