 Hillary Clinton on Thursday called for gun control measures and reiterated President Obama’s statement that terrorism had not been ruled out as a motive in the mass shooting the day before that left 14 people dead. “This terrible shooting in California, I want people to feel safe,” Mrs. Clinton said during a visit to a small business in Nashua, N.H. “If you go to the store, or you go to work, you go to the movies, you go to church, you take your kid to school — you should be safe.” She did not definitively blame Islamic terrorism for the shooting, but she did not rule out that the Islamic State or another extremist organization could have been responsible.  “We don’t know the reason or motive yet behind what happened in San Bernardino yesterday,” she said. “But I just was told before coming in that the president says we can’t rule out terrorism.” Mrs. Clinton also talked about “the spread of violent jihadist terrorism, and the influence it has in getting more people to do these awful acts of violence across the world.” She added, “We have to fight them in the air, we have to fight them on the ground, and we have to fight them in cyberspace.”
