 Donald J. Trump and Hillary Clinton hold commanding leads in South Carolina ahead of the primary election there, according to a poll released Tuesday. A CNN/ORC survey found Mr. Trump drawing the most support of likely Republican voters, with 38 percent. He is trailed by Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, with 22 percent, followed by Senator Marco Rubio of Florida and Jeb Bush, with 14 percent and 10 percent. The poll shows Mr. Trump’s support remaining steady in South Carolina since October, while Mr. Cruz, who won the Iowa caucuses and performed well in New Hampshire, is on the rise. The Republican primary is on Saturday.  Republicans by far see Mr. Trump as the strongest candidate to handle the economy, illegal immigration and fighting terrorism. They also see him as the most likely to win in a general election. On social issues and foreign policy, Mr. Trump holds only slim leads over Mr. Cruz.  Mr. Trump has been facing attacks in recent days as his rivals look to blunt his momentum. The vitriol between him and Mr. Cruz has been especially pitched, as the Texas senator has sought to portray Mr. Trump as a fake Republican while Mr. Trump has questioned Mr. Cruz’s mental stability. On the other side, 56 percent of likely Democratic voters in South Carolina support Mrs. Clinton, compared with 38 percent who back Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont.  Mrs. Clinton wins handily on all issues, with vast advantages on health care policy and race relations. Mr. Sanders does manage to keep it close on gun policy, an issue that some Democrats say he has been weak on.   With Democrats holding their South Carolina primary on Feb. 27, Mr. Sanders has just over 10 days to narrow the gap with Mrs. Clinton. Although time is short, only 43 percent of likely voters say they have definitely decided upon a candidate.  The poll of Republicans has a margin of error of plus or minus 5 percentage points. The margin of error for Democrats is plus or minus 6 percentage points.
