 LAS VEGAS — Since Jeb Bush’s withdrawal from the presidential race on Saturday, endorsements from prominent Republicans have been piling up for Senator Marco Rubio of Florida. Just in the last day, former Senator Bob Dole of Kansas, Senator Orrin Hatch of Utah and Gov. Asa Hutchison of Arkansas have signed on. But there is one endorsement that remains elusive: Mr. Bush’s. Leaving Nevada on Tuesday for a day of campaigning in Minnesota and Michigan, Mr. Rubio told reporters that he had spoken on Monday with Mr. Bush, the former governor, who was his mentor in Florida politics. He said the two planned to meet sometime in the near future. Mr. Rubio said he had not asked for Mr. Bush’s endorsement. “He’s just decompressing from this election,” Mr. Rubio told reporters. “And trying to get going again in the rest of his life. But we’ll meet and talk soon enough.” He characterized their talk as friendly. “A nice conversation,” he said. “We’re going to get together soon.” Despite the acrimony between their two campaigns, Mr. Rubio said, “Things happen.”  He added, “But that’s never changed my feelings toward him. And I don’t think that has changed his feelings toward me.”
