 Donald J. Trump’s advisers have hired new aides in Virginia, Texas and Florida, three states beyond where the early votes are cast, as they try to demonstrate that the real estate mogul will remain in the race for the duration.  Karen Giorno will be the campaign’s state director in Florida, while Corbin Casteel will play that role in Texas. Mike Rubino will be the state director in Virginia. “We are in this to win it,” Mr. Trump said in a statement. “These staff additions are the continuation of our plan to have a strategic and significant presence across the country.” Ms. Giorno previously worked for Gov. Rick Scott of Florida, according to Mr. Trump’s aides. Mr. Casteel was also described as having “vast experience” in corporation communications and political strategy, and worked with the Republican National Committee. Mr. Rubino was said to have worked with Representative David Brat, a Republican from Virginia who defeated Eric Cantor, then the House majority leader, in a June 2014 primary upset.  Mr. Trump has recently bristled at suggestions that he may not stay in the race until the Iowa caucuses begin in early February.  Texas and Virginia will hold their primaries on March 1, which is also known as Super Tuesday, when many states will vote. Florida will hold its primary on March 15.
