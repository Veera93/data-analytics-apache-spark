 Donald J. Trump responded with a familiar refrain to reports that Jeb Bush’s aides had researched the legal implications of saying that Mr. Bush wouldn’t support the real estate developer should he become the Republican nominee.  “I really don’t want Jeb’s endorsement, because he is a low-energy person and he does not represent strength, power and stamina, which are qualities our country desperately needs,” Mr. Trump said in an email sent by his spokeswoman, Hope Hicks. “But if he does not endorse and support me as the nominee, legally he cannot be on the ballot in many states so that would be the end of his candidacy — but that doesn’t matter because he is not going to win anyway,” Mr. Trump said. “While everyone said I beat him last night, I was only responding to his desperate attempt to stay relevant by attacking me. Everybody said I won the debate last night.”  Mr. Bush lobbed some of his toughest shots so far at Mr. Trump in the CNN debate in Las Vegas on Tuesday night, describing him as a “chaos” candidate. And despite Mr. Trump’s self-assessment of his debate performance, several analysts gave Mr. Bush points for aggressiveness in their exchanges.  In an interview with MSNBC right after the debate, Mr. Trump had praise for Mr. Bush, declining to speak poorly of him. But Wednesday morning, it was reported that the Bush team had looked into disavowing a pledge that all the Republican candidates signed to support the eventual nominee. Such a disavowal could potentially keep Mr. Bush off primary ballots in states that are requiring all candidates to sign such a pledge. Tim Miller, a spokesman for Mr. Bush, said, “Glad Donald finally came up with a comeback to Jeb a day late,” adding, “Jeb made his view on Trumps chaos candidacy crystal clear last night.”
