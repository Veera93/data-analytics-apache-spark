These are the places, faces and culinary selections of 2016’s first proper bus tour. EVENT 28 Time: 7:58 p.m., Jan. 9 Place: Waverly, Iowa (population: 9,874) Site: Wartburg College, in a midsize auditorium filled well beyond seating capacity for the trip’s final stop. Mood: last class before winter break Psychology: When Mr. Cruz delivered a typical stump speech prediction — that hordes of journalists would require therapy during a Cruz administration — an attendee turned to the assembled news media. “That you guys?” he asked, nudging two reporters. Economics: Mr. Cruz has taken care in recent days to highlight his relative youth. During an answer on the struggles of young adults, he noted his own student debt experience. “By the way, I paid off my student loans about six years ago,” said Mr. Cruz, who is 45. “So this is not ancient history to me.” Assignment: Mr. Cruz, closing his speech, made his standard final pitch, asking attendees to do three things: Vote for him. Volunteer. And pray, for at least a minute daily, until the caucuses on Feb. 1. Highlight: Greeting reporters for the final time this week, Mr. Cruz suggested an immediate sequel. “I’m tempted to announce that we’re going to launch another six days and 28 counties starting tomorrow,” he said. “But I’m afraid y’all would take your cameras and beat me over the head.”
