 DES MOINES – Senator Ted Cruz of Texas on Thursday won the endorsement of Bob Vander Plaats, an influential leader of Iowa’s Christian right, who called on conservatives to unite behind Mr. Cruz, now in a close contest with Donald J. Trump in the state. Mr. Vander Plaats, the president and chief executive of the Family Leader, a group staunchly opposed to abortion and same-sex marriage, backed the winners of the past two Republican caucuses, Mike Huckabee in 2008 and Rick Santorum in 2012. In both cases, however, the caucus winners were too conservative and underfunded to capture the party’s nomination. This time, Mr. Vander Plaats said, Mr. Cruz is much better positioned to be the nominee because of deep financial resources and a national grass-roots revolt against the Republican establishment. “We will be going all in for Senator Ted Cruz,’’ Mr. Vander Plaats said, speaking in the rotunda of the state Capitol.  In an Iowa poll this week, Mr. Cruz was in first place for the first time in an early voting state, but a second poll showed Mr. Trump leading. The two are increasingly in a battle for the state’s more conservative voters, with Mr. Cruz appealing more to evangelicals and Mr. Trump to more secular, disaffected blue-collar Iowans.         Bryan English, Mr. Cruz’s Iowa director, called the endorsement “a very significant day in the campaign” because of Mr. Vander Plaats’s influence with “an audience that is highly motivated.’’ Evangelical Christians represented about 60 percent of voters in the past two Republican caucuses, ensuring Mr. Huckabee’s victory in 2008 and Mr. Santorum’s  in 2012. Their eventual collapse, in the view of many conservatives, was because the party’s right wing never united behind them. National social conservative leaders have sought to avoid the same fate this year, holding many private meetings to discuss which candidate to endorse. Mr. Cruz seems to be emerging as their choice: On Wednesday he won the support of the National Organization for Marriage and Richard A. Viguerie, a conservative activist.  Sam Lau, the communications director for the Iowa Democratic Party, said in a statement that Mr. Vander Plaats’s endorsement might be good for Mr. Cruz but that the senator’s “divisive, regressive policies” were “a loss for Iowa’s families.” With the Vander Plaats endorsement, Mr. Cruz has swept up Iowa’s three most influential social conservatives; the others are Representative Steve King and Steve Deace, a talk-radio host.  Mr. Vander Plaats’s endorsement of Mr. Santorum in 2012 came under fire over charges that Mr. Vander Plaats had asked for money to promote the endorsement through a “super PAC.’’ This month the Federal Elections Commission, after two years of investigations, dismissed a complaint of improper payments.  Mr. Vander Plaats was asked on Thursday if he had asked the Cruz campaign or outside supporters to make contributions. “Absolutely not,’’ he said.  “There is no quid pro quo.’’ “There were no negotiations on anything, whether it be monetary or otherwise for our endorsement,’’ he said.
