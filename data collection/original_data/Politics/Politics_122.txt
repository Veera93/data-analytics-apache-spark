 The Obama administration and its allies are confident that Thursday’s federal court ruling, gutting an important part of the new health care law, will be overturned on appeal. But Republicans were not worrying about that for the moment. They were too busy celebrating the decision. After years of complaints that the Obama White House was flagrantly exceeding its executive authority on a range of issues, a federal district court judge in Washington, Rosemary W. Collyer, agreed with Republicans on the Affordable Care Act, finding that Congress had not funded a $130 billion program providing subsides to insurance companies. “This is a historic win for the Constitution and the American people,” Speaker Paul D. Ryan said in a typical reaction. “The executive branch is being held accountable to We the People.” The victory was particularly sweet for former Speaker John A. Boehner, but it may have also been bittersweet. The suit was the brainchild of Mr. Boehner and members of his staff, who initiated it as a way to challenge the new health care law. They recognized that congressional Republicans were never going to be successful in repealing the health care law with Mr. Obama in the White House (i.e., the failed shutdown in 2013) and looked for a more fruitful way to undermine it.  Despite his efforts, Mr. Boehner was ultimately forced out of the speakership last year by a group of hard-right conservatives who viewed him as not aggressive enough in calling the administration to account. But their tactics failed, while his have produced some actual results, however the case ultimately turns out at the appeals court level.
