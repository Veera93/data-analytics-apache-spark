 Martin O’Malley, the former governor of Maryland who has lagged in polls by double digits as the Democratic voting contests approach, has qualified for the final debate before the Feb. 1 Iowa caucuses, NBC executives announced on Thursday.  That makes three candidates who will be onstage: Mr. O’Malley, Hillary Clinton and Senator Bernie Sanders.  The debate will take place in prime time on Sunday in Charleston, S.C. The city is also the site of the Republican presidential primary debate, put on by Fox Business Network, on Thursday night.  The threshold for making the debate was a 5 percent average in five recent polls recognized by NBC News either nationally or in one of the early voting states of Iowa, New Hampshire or South Carolina, raising the prospect that Mr. O’Malley would not qualify. He has polled at roughly 5 percent in Iowa, and two recent surveys by NBC/Wall Street Journal/Marist and by The Des Moines Register/Bloomberg Politics apparently did not bring his number down.  Sponsors of Republican debates have used similar criteria in trying to winnow the large field of candidates; Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky and Carly Fiorina were among those left out of Thursday’s main debate. Mr. Paul said he will not participate in the so-called undercard debate, preceding the main debate, that is reserved for the lower-polling candidates.
