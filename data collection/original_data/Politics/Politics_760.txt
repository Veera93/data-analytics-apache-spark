 President Obama is back in Washington, but the Senate remains out of town on the President’s Day holiday recess — and that has its benefits and disadvantages as the Supreme Court fight heats up. On the positive side, Republican senators don’t have to spend their days in the Capitol dodging reporters and answering tough questions about their views on whether to vote to fill the vacancy resulting from Justice Antonin Scalia’s death, or if they should consider a replacement at all.  On the negative side, not being assembled together in Washington makes it harder for Republicans to deliver a unified message or even come to a clear agreement on what their approach should be. Many senators are on congressional trips around the world, making it difficult for them to keep up with events. Other senators who are traveling their home states are providing mixed messages such as when Senator Thom Tillis, Republican of North Carolina, used a local media appearance on Tuesday to caution his colleagues against falling into a trap of being labeled obstructionists. The absence of the opposition in Washington also let Mr. Obama dominate the news cycle on Tuesday with his news conference chiding Senate Republicans for threatening to simply sit on any nomination. The party response was fairly muted, though the Republican National Committee eventually took issue with the president, saying, “The American people‎ should have a voice in the selection of their next Supreme Court justice by allowing this issue to be front and center in this year’s election.”
