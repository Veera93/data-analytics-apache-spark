 Gov. John Kasich of Ohio has hired his longtime admaker and strategist, Rex Elsass, who had been working for Rand Paul’s campaign before the Kentucky senator bowed out of the race, a spokesman for Mr. Kasich said on Thursday.  Mr. Elsass, who made ads for Mr. Kasich’s re-election effort in 2014, is a major addition to the governor’s team, which includes John Weaver, a veteran Republican strategist who has been steering the campaign from the beginning.  “We love to have him back in the family, and he’s working on a spot to go up later this week” in South Carolina, said Chris Schrimpf, the Kasich campaign spokesman.  Mr. Elsass had been advising Mr. Paul’s presidential campaign, which Mr. Paul suspended after the Iowa caucuses. But Mr. Kasich’s team, even while Mr. Elsass was working for another candidate, borrowed some of the footage used in ads for Mr. Kasich’s campaign for governor.
