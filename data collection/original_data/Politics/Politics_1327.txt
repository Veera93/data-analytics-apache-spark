 Ben Carson is taking Christmas carol recommendations in a recent ad. Senator Ted Cruz is reading “holiday tales” to his daughters. And Hillary Clinton’s campaign team has animated its version of a Christmas classic. Indeed, candidates are starting to get in the holiday spirit with their political advertising, and they are more than willing to share, sometimes even for a cost, that spirit with voters. Mr. Cruz’s ad, which his campaign described as “campy,” was done in the style of “Saturday Night Live” faux commercials, running during the Dec. 19 episode in Iowa. It features the senator from Texas reading to his two daughters, Caroline and Catherine, conservative spins on Christmas stories, like “Rudolph the Underemployed Reindeer,” “Auditing St. Nick,” and “Frosty: The Speaker of the House,” which featured a snowman having a cigarette and carrying a glass of red wine, a not-so-subtle holiday message to former Speaker John A. Boehner. The Clinton campaign created its own Christmas tale, animated in the style of Dr. Seuss, called “How the Republicans Steal Progress.” It criticizes the “grinches in GOPville,” a play on Whoville, the town in “How the Grinch Stole Christmas.” A rhyming narrative spins along, with splices of Republican candidates cutting into the piece. It’s running online only. But it is Mr. Carson, through his campaign’s iPhone app, who has been celebrating the Christmas spirit most frequently, quizzing supporters on Christmas trivia, calling for users to share their favorite Christmas song and offering downloadable Christmas coloring books, where a user can color in pictures of Mr. Carson’s campaign slogans or bookshelves filled with his many books, possibly a subtle hint at a last-minute gift idea as well.
