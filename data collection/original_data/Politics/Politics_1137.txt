 After a week of spending “big” on television advertising, Donald J. Trump appears to be slowing his pace. For his second week of advertising, Mr. Trump is spending roughly a third of what he did in his first week, with about $750,000 in reservations in Iowa and New Hampshire, according to multiple media buyers. At the beginning of the month, Mr. Trump pledged to spend at least $2 million a week on advertising, and he did so for the first week. But when it came time to renew or reserve new advertising, Mr. Trump is taking a more frugal approach, reserving about $315,000 in New Hampshire and $350,000 in Iowa. The smaller presence will be felt more in Iowa, where Mr. Trump spent most of his initial advertising investment. Last week, Mr. Trump had spent $1.3 million on cable and broadcast in the state, and about $800,000 in New Hampshire. In splitting his ad reservations evenly through those states, he is spending less in Iowa, even as he now trails Senator Ted Cruz of Texas in most polls there. The campaign is also still using only the first advertisement it produced, a spot that focuses on the most controversial aspects of his stump speech.   But for Mr. Trump, whose presence is near constant on cable news networks, the cutback in advertising could be matched with an accelerated call-in or television presence.  Mr. Trump can, of course, reserve more airtime as the week progresses; there is no cutoff date for when a campaign must turn in its reservations, although they must come in by a certain point on Friday to guarantee placement for the weekend or for Monday morning. The Trump campaign did not respond on Wednesday night when asked for a comment on their reduced airtime.
