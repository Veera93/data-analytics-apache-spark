 BOULDER, Colo. — Viewers of Wednesday’s Republican debate here will be treated to a decidedly liberal perspective — at least for 30 seconds. NextGen Climate, the outside group founded by the billionaire environmentalist and philanthropist Tom Steyer, is airing an ad on CNBC — the business network hosting the debate — during the prime-time face-off Wednesday that will cast climate change as an economic issue.  The 30-second spot, “Who We Are,” will run as part of a six-figure buy that also includes several days of digital ads, the group said. “Tomorrow’s debate will focus on the economy — and it’s hard to ignore the biggest threat to our economy: climate change,” said Suzanne Henkels, spokeswoman for NextGen Climate. “We’ve seen the G.O.P. candidates use the economy as an excuse for dodging questions on climate change, but in fact not addressing climate change would cost us $44 trillion in lost global G.D.P.” The ad opens with black-and-white footage of moments of American achievement, as a narrator says: “America has never been a country of quitters. It’s not who we are.” “We don’t ignore threats like climate change — we face our problems head on,” the narrator continues, as images of everyday Americans, as well as wind farms, scroll by. “With American-made clean energy, we can end our dependence on foreign oil, spark new innovation and create millions of new jobs.” This month, NextGen Climate announced a seven-figure ad campaign urging the 2016 presidential candidates to commit to achieving 50 percent clean energy by 2030. And during the 2014 cycle, the group spent about $100 million to try to influence several key Senate and governor’s races, where climate change was expected to play a significant role.
