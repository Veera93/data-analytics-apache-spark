 Donald J. Trump wavered on Tuesday about whether he would actually pay the legal fees of a supporter who punched a protester in the face at one of his rallies last week, saying that he does not condone violence.  Last Wednesday, at an event in North Carolina, one of Mr. Trump’s backers was arrested and charged with assault and other crimes for attacking a man who was being escorted out of an arena. Mr. Trump has said in the past that he would pay the legal fees of supporters who roughed up protesters, and on Sunday he said that he was instructing members of his staff to look into doing so in this case. Speaking on ABC’s “Good Morning America” on Tuesday, Mr. Trump acknowledged that paying legal fees in this case might be an endorsement of violence. “I don’t condone violence and I didn’t say I was going to pay for his fees,” Mr. Trump said. “Nobody asked me to pay for fees.” Asked if paying the legal fees of people who commit acts of violence, in any case, would be wrong, Mr. Trump seemed to concede that it was not a good idea. “Maybe so, and maybe that’s why I wouldn’t do it,” Mr. Trump said. “I don’t condone violence at all.”
