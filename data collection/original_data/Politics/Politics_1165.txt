 When Senator John McCain of Arizona, the 2008 Republican nominee for president, faced questions about meeting the constitutional qualifications because of his birth in the Panama Canal Zone, one Democratic colleague rushed to end any doubt. The Democrat, Claire McCaskill of Missouri, introduced legislation to declare that any child born abroad to citizens serving in the United States military would meet the constitutional requirement as a “natural born” citizen. But now that Senator Ted Cruz, Republican of Texas, faces similar questions about his birth in Canada, Ms. McCaskill is not exactly extending a helping hand.  Mr. Cruz was born in Calgary, Alberta, where his father, a native of Cuba, was working in the oil industry. Mr. Cruz became an American citizen by birth thanks to his mother, a United States citizen who had been born in Delaware. And many legal experts say that clears him to hold the nation’s highest office.  Ms. McCaskill, however, said that she saw a difference between Mr. McCain’s case, in which his father was a naval officer stationed in the Panama Canal Zone, and that of Mr. Cruz. In an interview at the Capitol, Ms. McCaskill cited doubts recently raised in The Guardian by Laurence Tribe, the renowned Harvard law professor. In pressing doubts about Mr. Cruz’s qualifications, Donald J. Trump, a rival for the Republican nomination, has cited Mr. Tribe’s constitutional expertise.  “I think it’s a question,” Ms. McCaskill said of Mr. Cruz’s eligibility. “When Laurence Tribe says it’s a question, it’s a question.”  She said the McCain family’s military service is what prompted her quick proposal of legislation in 2008.  “My interest in that was my father was military, and I was raised really near a military base, and the notion that someone who was born in another country because his parents were serving in the military — it was offensive to me that they couldn’t be president of the United States,” she said. “That’s why I was so motivated.”
