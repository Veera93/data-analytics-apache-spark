 PLYMOUTH, N.H. — At virtually every campaign stop, Senator Ted Cruz of Texas tells the tale of his father’s exodus from Cuba. He is less likely to speak the country’s official language. But inside a pub teeming with supporters here, including a small group of Spanish speakers, Mr. Cruz could not resist a stab at the language that competitors like Senator Marco Rubio of Florida and Jeb Bush speak much more readily. (Mr. Cruz has appraised his own Spanish as “lousy.”)   “Qué bueno!” he said, turning to the group’s members as he took questions from the crowd. “De dónde?”  They said they, too, had Cuban roots.  “O.K., you guys are in trouble,” he said, to laughs. “There’re too many Cubans in the room.”  Mr. Cruz was two days into a five-day bus tour through the state, amid an increasingly heated contest with Donald J. Trump. Among other issues, the two have tussled over Mr. Cruz’s slight that Mr. Trump embodied “New York values.”  On this point, one of the Spanish speakers seemed to have Mr. Cruz’s back.  “I’m a conservative from New York City,” she said.  “Fantastic!” Mr. Cruz said.
