 Megyn Kelly and Donald Trump have reached a détente: Mr. Trump will appear on Ms. Kelly’s primetime special next month, Fox News announced on Monday.  Ms. Kelly and Mr. Trump’s monthslong dispute has been the centerpiece of the Republican presidential candidate’s on-again, off-again feud with Fox News.  This month, Ms. Kelly visited Mr. Trump in his Midtown Manhattan office in an attempt to, as she said, “clear the air,” and discuss the possibility of an interview. Afterward, Mr. Trump went off to lunch with the chairman of Fox News, Roger Ailes, at the network’s offices. In a statement on Monday, Ms. Kelly said: “Mr. Trump and I sat down together for a meeting earlier this month at my request. He was gracious with his time and I asked him to consider an interview. I am happy to announce he has agreed, and I look forward to a fascinating exchange — our first sit-down interview together in nearly a year.”  The prime-time special, “Megyn Kelly Presents,” will be broadcast on May 17. Fox said the show would feature several guests, most likely including some celebrities. Mr. Trump is the first announced guest.
