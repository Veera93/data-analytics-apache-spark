 Donald J. Trump returns to Iowa on Tuesday amid a deepening faith-focused feud with Senator Ted Cruz of Texas.  Mr. Trump said at a town-hall-style event in Concord, N.H., on Monday that he would receive a big endorsement on Tuesday. Mr. Trump’s aides declined to say whom it would be from, and said that additional endorsements would follow as he makes his final push in Iowa and New Hampshire.  Among other events on Tuesday, Mr. Trump will appear at a summit meeting hosted by groups supporting renewable fuels, which include ethanol, a corn-based substance. He has criticized Mr. Cruz for inconsistent views on supporting renewable fuel standards.  Mr. Trump is locked in a battle for conservative voters with Mr. Cruz. They have been wielding the rhetorical blade against each other since the Republican presidential debate last week, when Mr. Cruz arched an eyebrow at Mr. Trump’s “New York values” and suggested that his rival was attacking him only because the polls had tightened.  For his part, Mr. Trump has questioned Mr. Cruz’s eligibility to serve as president (Mr. Cruz, who was born in Canada but whose mother was a United States citizen, insists this is not an issue) and has talked about loans that Mr. Cruz received, but did not disclose on federal forms as required, from Goldman Sachs and Citibank for his 2012 Senate campaign.  It seems unlikely that Mr. Trump is going to let up: He rarely does once he has trained his sights on a rival. And his two-day trip to Iowa will be his longest stretch of events in the state, with three stops on Tuesday and one on Wednesday morning.  Mr. Cruz is in New Hampshire for a four-day bus tour, where he described Mr. Trump as “rattled” by the race’s changing dynamic.  The expectations have changed in recent weeks to a conventional wisdom in which Iowa is Mr. Cruz’s to lose and Mr. Trump is sagging there with a less-than-stellar ground game to mobilize his voters. But so far, he is showing no signs of ceding the state.
