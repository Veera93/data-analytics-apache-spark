 Senator Marco Rubio of Florida took in just $6 million for his presidential campaign from July to the end of September, a major drop to his fund-raising pace over a summer in which two Republican rivals dropped out because they lacked enough money to continue. Mr. Rubioâ€™s total, announced at a gathering of donors and other supporters in Las Vegas, underscores the hesitation among the Republican donor class during a period when outsider candidates, such as Donald J. Trump and Ben Carson, were dominating many polls. It is well below the roughly $9 million that Mr. Rubio raised during the quarter after he announced his White House bid in mid-April, and almost half as much money per week as Mr. Rubio raised through the end of June. The figures suggest Mr. Rubio spent most of the money he raised over the summer, traditionally a slow period for large-dollar presidential fund-raising. But he retains a substantial war chest of $11 million, thanks in part to $3 million in contributions he transferred from his Senate campaign committee when he entered the presidential race. Mr. Carson, riding on a surge of small donors, raised $20 million during the same period, although he also spent heavily on direct mail and telephone solicitations. Jeb Bush, the former Florida governor, has not yet disclosed his fund-raising for the third quarter, nor has Senator Ted Cruz of Texas.
