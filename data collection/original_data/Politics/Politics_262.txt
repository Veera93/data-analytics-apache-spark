 Donald J. Trump said on Sunday that he hoped the Republican National Convention “doesn’t involve violence” as he pressed his case that the system is rigged against him. “I hope it doesn’t involve violence,” Mr. Trump said at a news conference on Staten Island, a stronghold of support, after he was given an award by the New York Veteran Police Association and spoke at a Lincoln Day brunch for Republicans.”I hope it doesn’t. I’m not suggesting that.”  He added: “I don’t think it will. But I will say this, it’s a rigged system, it’s a crooked system.”  Mr. Trump stopped short of saying he would not accept the nominee if it was someone else at the convention July 18-21 in Cleveland, saying he had to see how the process played out. “I have to see how it’s handled and what level of fairness” he is afforded, Mr. Trump said. But it was the latest in an escalating war against the Republican National Committee over how the delegates are selected.  Mr. Trump also pointed to the various means at his disposal to try to lure delegates, with rides on his plane and trips to his high-end clubs, but he insisted he thinks that is a lurid game.  “Nobody has better toys than I do,” Mr. Trump said, describing how that process might work: “’Delegate, listen, we’re going to send you to Mar-a-Lago on a Boeing 757, you’re going to use the spa, you’re going to do this, you’re going to do that, we want your vote.’ That’s a corrupt system.”
