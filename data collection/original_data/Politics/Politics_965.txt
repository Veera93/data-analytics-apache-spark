 With the Iowa caucuses just days away, the fractious presidential primary campaign was the talk of Capitol Hill on Wednesday. Senator Harry Reid, for one, probably wishes he had stayed quiet on the subject of Donald J. Trump. After joking earlier with reporters that he was “kind of pulling for Trump” given the Republican alternatives, Mr. Reid, the Democratic leader from Nevada, went to the floor to retract his comments. In the House, they call that revising and extending your remarks.  “I tried to be funny an hour ago,” said a contrite Mr. Reid, who acknowledged that even his joking praise of Mr. Trump was wrong. “The danger a Donald Trump candidacy poses for our country is not a joke. Since he launched his bid for the Republican nomination, Donald Trump has proven over and over again that he is a hateful demagogue who would do immeasurable damage to our country if elected.” On the Democratic candidate side, Representative Nancy Pelosi of California made clear to reporters at a party retreat in Baltimore that she was thrilled with the prospective new voters that Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont is drawing to his presidential rallies. But Ms. Pelosi, the House Democratic leader, is not so enthusiastic about some of his proposals that could require raising taxes. “We’re not running on any platform of raising taxes,” she said. Senator Mitch McConnell, the Kentucky Republican and majority leader, sought to keep clear of the presidential mess altogether when pressed on his thoughts about Mr. Trump skipping this week’s Republican debate. “I’m not going to start talking about the presidential campaign,” said the notoriously disciplined Mr. McConnell. “There’d be no place to end the discussion.”
