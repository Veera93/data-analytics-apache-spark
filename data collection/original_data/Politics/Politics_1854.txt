 Want to meet the Bush family? Get ready to read plenty of fine print. In the latest embrace of his presidential family roots, Jeb Bush has opened a sweepstakes that will bring a lucky winner to Houston to meet all the big-name Bushes, including the 41st and 43rd presidents. “We’re not joking when we say this type of contest won’t come along for awhile,” George P. Bush, Jeb’s son, wrote in a fund-raising email to supporters. As in many contests, there are catches, and the Bush lottery comes with more than 1,200 words of special rules. Among the caveats are that contestants do not have to make a donation to vie for a chance to win, Floridians are excluded from playing, and the airfare and hotel — worth nearly $2,000 – are taxable as income. “Winners will receive an I.R.S. 1099 form for the value of the prize,” according to the guidelines. However, unlike in a traditional sweepstakes, Mr. Bush is not leaving things entirely to chance. Perhaps to ensure that no Democrats, or Trump backers, crash the party, the campaign is drawing 10 potential winners, then choosing the person best representing Mr. Bush’s support across the country.
