 Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont is determined to continue his campaign despite losing at least four of the five states that voted on Tuesday. Mr. Sanders’s campaign manager, Jeff Weaver, and his senior campaign adviser, Tad Devine, spoke to reporters on Wednesday afternoon and said that Mr. Sanders could make up Hillary Clinton’s delegate lead. They added that Mr. Sanders expected to do well in the coming elections in Arizona, Idaho, New York, Utah, Washington and Wisconsin. “We are literally about halfway through,” Mr. Weaver said. “Clearly the Clinton campaign has run up a bit of a lead in the first half of it, but the second half is much more favorable to Senator Sanders in terms of the calendar, in terms of the geography, in terms of the spacing of the states.” Mr. Weaver added that campaign advisers still see a path forward. “What our calculation shows is that we can in fact pass the secretary in pledged delegates,” he said. “We are feeling very good, and we are essentially where we expected to be at this point in the race.” Mr. Devine echoed those sentiments. “We agree we are behind, but we also think we are going to win this game,” Mr. Devine said. “We are just not intimidated by the numbers.” The two men also said that it would be unfair to not allow voters in all states to be able to cast their ballots for Mr. Sanders and that the senator had the money to continue his campaign through the convention this summer.
