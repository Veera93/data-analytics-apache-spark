 By the time Gov. Scott Walker of Wisconsin departed the presidential race, his campaign was $161,000 in debt, having raised $7.3 million and spent $6.3 million, campaign finance filings released Thursday show.  There was nearly $1 million left in cash on hand, which could be earmarked for settling some outstanding receipts that haven’t been filed yet.  One of Mr. Walker’s selling points was that he would be an effective steward of the country’s finances. But his campaign filings reveal a bloated payroll and high salaries, with Mr. Walker’s campaign manager, Rick Wiley, on course to make $200,000 for the year.  There were travel bills and hotel rentals. But there was little in the way of investment in tangible infrastructure in the early voting states.  By the time Mr. Walker dropped out on Sept. 21, in one of the most surprising turns of events of the early 2016 presidential campaign, his payroll had swelled to cover dozens of people, according to a person familiar with his campaign staff. There would have had to be substantial layoffs for Mr. Walker to remain in the race.  Mr. Walker’s sons, Alex and Matthew, also showed up on the payroll, each making just over $4,000 during the course of the campaign. Rick Perry, meanwhile, who also dropped out of the race in September, was spending his money even more quickly before he exited. He raised only $287,199 last quarter—far less than other major candidates, his report showed. After spending about $1.1 million on his campaign, he was left with only $44,553 in the bank. “I step aside knowing our party is in good hands,” Mr. Perry said when he dropped out on Sept. 11.
