 Ted Cruz is on a six-day, 28-town swing through Iowa. These are the places, faces and culinary selections of 2016’s first proper bus tour. EVENT 10 Time: 12:25 p.m., Jan. 6 Place: Sibley, Iowa (population: 2,798) Site: Lantern Coffeehouse &amp; Roastery, with exposed brick walls and snowfall visible through the front windows Mood: vigorous nodding, warm drinks Food: rainbow candy canes, Trader Joe’s Speculoos cookie butter, soft molasses cookies (three for $1) Tunes: Saying he hoped for snow on caucus day, Bob Vander Plaats, an Iowa religious leader and Cruz endorser, broke briefly into song: “I’m dreaming … of a whiiiiiite … caucus.” Reviews were mixed. “It’s bad, I know,” he said. Beetlejuice-esque website plug: “TedCruz.org,” Mr. Cruz said at one point, adding, “TedCruz.org. TedCruz.org.” Highlight: Mr. Cruz lampooned the anodyne “issues” pages populating most candidates’ websites. He used gun rights as an example. “In a Republican primary in Texas or Iowa, there is a right answer on the Second Amendment: ‘I support the Second Amendment,’” he said. “Unless you are clinically insane, that’s what you say.” His page, by contrast, includes a “Proven Record” tab as well, detailing his practical experience. “I don’t say a word,” he said,” about what’s hidden in the deep recesses of my heart.”
