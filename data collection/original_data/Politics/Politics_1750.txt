 After a debate featuring several confrontations between the presidential candidates and the moderators, Reince Priebus, the chairman of the Republican National Committee, expressed extreme displeasure with the evening’s cable hosts. “I think it was one gotcha question, one personal low blow after the other,” he said of the CNBC team, speaking to reporters in the postdebate spin room. “It’s almost like they tried to design the Rubik’s Cube with every question — to take the worst element, I think, of what moderators and what the media should bring to the table.”  “All I can tell you,” he continued, “is while I’m proud of our candidates for pretty much sticking together, I’m very disappointed in the moderators.” He ignored a question about whether the evening would affect the party’s relationship with CNBC.
