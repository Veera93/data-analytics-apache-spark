 The Republican presidential field will gather for another debate on Jan. 14, two days after the presidentâ€™s State of the Union address, Fox Business Network announced on Tuesday.  The debate, to be held in North Charleston, S.C., will come between two previously scheduled debates: on Dec. 15 (hosted by CNN in Las Vegas), and Jan. 28 (Fox News in Iowa). That last debate is just days before the Iowa caucuses.  Fox Business Network hosted the most recent Republican debate, on Nov. 10, receiving warm reviews from the candidates and the Republican Party for their handling of questions and policy, after CNBC was criticized for how its anchors performed in a debate a month earlier.   Moderators, entry criteria and additional debate information will be released closer to the date, according to a news release.
