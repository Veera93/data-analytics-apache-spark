 A “super PAC” backing Senator Ted Cruz of Texas in the Republican presidential race has invested an additional $2.5 million in television ad reservations in Iowa and South Carolina as the contest hurtles toward the first votes.  The new ad reservations, which are in addition to $1 million that the group, Keep the Promise I, bought in those states and in New Hampshire, comes as Mr. Cruz finds himself under intense criticism from his rivals, including Donald J. Trump and Senator Marco Rubio of Florida.  The first spot, called “Record, not Rhetoric,” is a positive spot depicting Mr. Cruz as the only person in the wide G.O.P. field who will do what he says he will do and who has a record of taking on fights in Washington, a key part of the senator’s message to voters.  “Ted Cruz is a top-tier contender facing vicious attacks designed to frighten voters rather than inform them. Voters have a reasonable expectation that leaders will have thought deeply and fought heartily long before campaign season. ‘Who can you trust?’ and ‘Who has been there?’ are the same question,” said Kellyanne Conway, the president of the super PAC.  In a veiled knife-twist at his more vocal opponents like Mr. Trump and Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey, Ms. Conway said that “a record – not rhetoric – shows who likes to fight for us, and who just likes to fight.”
