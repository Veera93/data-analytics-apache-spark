 Ted Cruz is on a six-day, 28-town swing through Iowa. These are the places, faces and culinary selections of 2016’s first proper bus tour. EVENT 13 Time: 8:31 p.m., Jan. 6 Place: Storm Lake, Iowa (population: 10,600) Site: King’s Pointe Waterpark Resort, in a lobby with a burning fireplace and a Christmas tree Mood: politically active ski lodge Best-dressed: Greg Stone, 46, a hotel guest who attended the event without shoes. “Only way to go,” he said, wiggling his toes. Steps taken by Mr. Cruz as of 9:35 p.m.: 12,697, he told reporters, checking his Fitbit Highlight: Mr. Cruz called on a woman, Ofelia Valdez, who said she had come to the country from Mexico as an undocumented teenager. Ms. Valdez has been able to stay under a federal work permit program, which Mr. Cruz opposes, for certain immigrants who arrived in their youth. She wondered about her fate in a Cruz presidency. “We are a country of immigrants,” Mr. Cruz said, “but it matters if you follow the rules.” “I consider myself as a part of the community,” Ms. Valdez said.  Being part of the federal program “means that you were brought here illegally,” Mr. Cruz replied calmly. “And violating the laws has consequences.”
