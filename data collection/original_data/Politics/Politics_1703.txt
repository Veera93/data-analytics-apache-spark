 Rank-and-file House Republicans have been demanding a greater role in legislating — and more amendments — which means longer debates and workdays at the Capitol. And Speaker Paul D. Ryan seems prepared to oblige. But election years also present their own special scheduling imperatives, given the need for lawmakers to defend their seats.  This was clear on Tuesday as the House majority leader, Representative Kevin McCarthy, Republican of California, published the legislative schedule for 2016, which, largely because of time off for political conventions and campaigning, will contain just 25 full four-day or five-day work weeks.  Because of the presidential nominating conventions, the House will begin its recess for the summer on July 15 and will not return until Sept. 6, the Tuesday after Labor Day. And it will go into recess again on Sept. 30, as representatives head home to campaign, reconvening on Nov. 14, the Monday after the election.  The Senate will have a similarly abridged schedule to allow for politics and campaigning, with an identical summer break. However, it is tentatively scheduled to work during the first week in October, adjourning on Oct. 7 until after the election.  Of course, lawmakers in competitive races will almost certainly be forced to work even harder in their home districts than in Washington, where their legislative duties will inevitably be interspersed with aggressive fund-raising and strategy sessions.
