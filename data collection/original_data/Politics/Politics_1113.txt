 Speaking to reporters after Thursday night’s debate, Donald J. Trump said, as he often does, that he was self-financing his campaign.  “I’m putting up my own,” he said. But the most recently filed campaign spending disclosures indicated that, in the third quarter of 2015, he put up just a little more than $100,000 of his own money but reimbursed $723,000 to an aviation company he owns. He was able to subsidize his own travel thanks to donors: The disclosures show he accepted just under $4 million in individual contributions during the third quarter. Mr. Trump still claims that he really is dipping into his own fortune to pay for his television ads. “I’ll put up a lot,” he promised.  “I’ll be putting up probably $30-40 million before the primary.” He said he just committed $6 million to a new series of commercials in Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina. Asked if he did so entirely with his own money, Mr. Trump shot back: “All mine.” The truth will not be entirely known until April. That is when the financial disclosures from this quarter are due.
