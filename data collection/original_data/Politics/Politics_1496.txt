 Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey may be betting the bank on New Hampshire, but for Hillary Clinton, winning the state’s Democratic primary on Feb. 9 is almost as pivotal.  Both Bill and Mrs. Clinton have always found a friendly electorate in New Hampshire, but in this election, she is confronting a local liberal favorite, Senator Bernie Sanders of neighboring Vermont, whose appeal in the state remains strong despite his dip against Mrs. Clinton lately in Iowa and elsewhere. On Thursday, Mrs. Clinton will begin a daylong blitz of events across the state, including a speech at the Women’s Economic Opportunity Summit in Manchester, a visit to a small business in Nashua and a town-hall-style meeting in Dover, her 16th such event or forum in New Hampshire this year.  Mr. Sanders’s strength in New Hampshire has translated into success in the polls as some state surveys have him ahead. Mrs. Clinton could, of course, finish second in New Hampshire and still capture the nomination, as her husband did in 1992, but the optics of losing a New England state that supported her strongly in 2008 would be a blow to her campaign as it moved into the next round of primaries.  On Friday, Mrs. Clinton will head to Iowa where she will talk about her new $275 billion infrastructure plan.
