 Republican senators who are thought most susceptible to a political backlash for blocking any new Supreme Court nominee appear to be shaking off concern and joining the call to wait for the next president to fill the vacancy caused by Antonin Scalia’s death. And that is just fine with some Democrats. While it might make it harder for Senate Democrats and the White House to force consideration of the eventual nominee, the decision by the vulnerable Republicans sets up the clear contrast that Democrats want in the handful of key races likely to decide Senate control in November. Senator Rob Portman of Ohio joined Republican Senate colleagues Ron Johnson of Wisconsin and Kelly Ayotte of New Hampshire in coming out for the delay on Monday. Republicans say they do not believe that getting behind the call to put off the confirmation will be that damaging and that Republican voters will reward them for doing so. Democrats see it very differently. One of their main concerns for months has been how to reproduce the surge of enthusiasm among young and minority voters who helped elect President Obama twice. They view the Republican refusal to consider a nominee with almost a year left in Mr. Obama’s tenure as a potent weapon to generate excitement. One top Democratic strategist said the court’s threat to climate change proposals would have particular resonance with young voters who can be difficult to spur to the polls. Democrats say an added benefit is that united Republican opposition could reinstate the party’s reputation for obstruction after Senator Mitch McConnell, the Kentucky Republican and majority leader, had recorded some success in getting the Senate back to work and passing bipartisan legislation. But those bills pale next to a stalled Supreme Court nominee.
