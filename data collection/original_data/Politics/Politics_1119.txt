 Senator Ted Cruz’s performance at the Republican presidential debate got low marks on Friday — from Donald J. Trump.  The billionaire developer made clear that their friendship was on the rocks, describing Mr. Cruz as “strident” and calling his characterization of New York City and its residents’ values “disgraceful.” “I don’t know about being a nice guy, because he came at me last night and it was inappropriate,” Mr. Trump told MSNBC’s “Morning Joe” program. “I thought that Ted did not have a good night last night and I thought his hit on New York was disgraceful, frankly.” Mr. Trump and Mr. Cruz engaged in sharp exchanges over the Texas senator’s eligibility to be president because he was born in Canada. They also clashed after Mr. Cruz reiterated that Mr. Trump embodies liberal “New York values.” Mr. Cruz mocked Mr. Trump’s so-called birther theories and appeared to get the better of him on that subject, while Mr. Trump scored points by invoking the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, when defending the honor of New Yorkers.  On Friday, Mr. Trump continued to raise questions about Mr. Cruz’s Canadian roots, calling it “a problem” and saying that lawsuits had already been filed to stop Mr. Cruz from running. As for Mr. Cruz’s characterization of New York, Mr. Trump remained offended.  “I thought it was terrible,” Mr. Trump said. “You know, you have offended about 20 million people. That’s a lot of people.” — Morning Joe (@Morning_Joe) January 15, 2016
