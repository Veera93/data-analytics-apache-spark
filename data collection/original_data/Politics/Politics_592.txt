 It did not go unnoticed among congressional Republicans that President Obama delivered his latest proposal for closing the Guantánamo Bay detention center standing before a portrait of Theodore Roosevelt in his incarnation as a Rough Rider in Cuba during the Spanish-American War. That same Roosevelt, later to become president, cited the authority Congress had granted him when he negotiated the lease of the property for a military base in exchange for granting independence to Cuba in the early 1900s. Fearing the administration is planning to turn over the base as it restores relations with the Cuban government, House Republicans are moving to remind Mr. Obama that Roosevelt relied on Congress and that Mr. Obama must do so as well. A bill introduced on Thursday by Representative Ed Royce, the California Republican who is chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, states that no change in control of the Guantánamo Bay Naval Station can be made without the consent of Congress or a treaty modification backed by the Senate. “Congress specifically provided the president the authority to acquire Guantánamo Bay from Cuba, and Congress should have a role in any decision to relinquish it,” Mr. Royce said. Suffice it to say, then, that any effort to give back the base is likely to encounter a rough ride up Capitol Hill.
