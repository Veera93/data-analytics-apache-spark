 Paul Singer, the billionaire financier who has supported conservative causes and who backed Senator Marco Rubio’s presidential campaign, said in a speech on Monday night that neither of the likely general election candidates was acceptable and urged conservatives to “stand up for what we believe.” Mr. Singer spoke at a gala that was held at Cipriani 42nd Street for the Manhattan Institute, a conservative group that he has been involved with for many years.  Mr. Singer’s remarks, which were shared by an attendee who took notes and were confirmed by a second guest, represent his most extensive comments so far about the presidential race, in which Donald J. Trump has emerged as the presumptive Republican nominee. Mr. Singer was among a group of donors who had funded efforts to stop Mr. Trump’s campaign.  But the comments also reflect a conversation that is beginning among writers, elected officials and donors over how to protect the conservative movement with Mr. Trump, whom many conservatives revile, at the top of the Republican ticket. The most prominent elected official to emerge from the conservative movement, the speaker of the House, Paul D. Ryan, has said he is not yet ready to endorse Mr. Trump.  “This is a difficult time,” Mr. Singer told those at the gala, “and in some respects a bleak time, in the political life of America.” The remarks were first reported by the website of The National Review. In his comments, Mr. Singer described Mr. Trump and Hillary Clinton as “signs of philosophical, policy and political exhaustion.”  In a clear signal that he does not want to encourage a Clinton presidency, Mr. Singer said both candidates reflect “the politics of anger and nostalgia, of visceral responses.”  He added, “It’s essential that we — individually, collectively, and through our institutions — stand up for what we believe.”  Those views, he said, are not “embodied in either choice that will apparently be on the ballot this November.”
