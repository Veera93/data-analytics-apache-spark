 It was odd enough to see Omarosa Manigault, the reality television star known for her villainous turn on “The Apprentice,” dissecting the presidential race with Wolf Blitzer during a live interview on CNN on Tuesday. Then things got really weird.  Ms. Manigault, a stalwart supporter of Donald J. Trump who has acted as a surrogate for his campaign, declared that Mr. Trump would dismiss his campaign manager, Corey Lewandowski, if he fails to win the Wisconsin Republican primary next week.  Her comments were exactly the opposite of what Mr. Trump had himself asserted in unequivocal terms just hours before, when he vehemently defended Mr. Lewandowski, who was arrested in Florida on Tuesday on charges of grabbing and shoving a reporter.  “I will tell you, if he loses Wisconsin, you won’t have to worry about Corey any longer, because he’ll become a liability, and Donald Trump will get rid of him,” Ms. Manigault said matter-of-factly. “If it does distract from the campaign, from the mission that Donald Trump has, then Donald Trump will have to deal with it.” Asked about Ms. Manigault’s remarks, a spokeswoman for Mr. Trump, Hope Hicks, said, “She does not speak for the campaign.” Ms. Manigault, who has become a semi-regular presence on television news as a defender of Mr. Trump, said that Mr. Lewandowski’s arrest “does not reflect well on Donald Trump’s campaign,” and she invoked Mr. Trump’s catchphrase, “You’re fired,” a line she herself heard on “The Apprentice.” Mr. Lewandowski, she said, “may be hearing those famous words.”
