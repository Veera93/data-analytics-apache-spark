 As a large Methodist conference is set to convene in Portland, Ore., on Tuesday with plans to consider the boycott, divestment and sanctions campaign, or B.D.S., against Israel, Hillary Clinton has written a letter denouncing the movement. Mrs. Clinton, a Methodist, wrote a letter on Sunday to leaders of prominent Jewish groups who had written to her about their concerns that the B.D.S. movement, which is critical of Israel’s policies toward the West Bank, would be a topic of discussion at the United Methodist General Conference.   David A. Sherman, the chairman of the Israel Action Network, and Susan K. Stern, of the Jewish Federations of North America, wrote to Mrs. Clinton, urging her to speak out.  In her letter, Mrs. Clinton reiterated her previous opposition to the B.D.S. movement, and pointed out that anti-Semitism is on the rise globally. She called the B.D.S. efforts “counterproductive.”  “Anti-Semitism has no place in any civilized society — not in America, not in Europe, not anywhere,” Mrs. Clinton wrote. “We must never tire in defending Israel’s legitimacy.”  She added: “I believe that B.D.S. seeks to punish Israel and dictate how the Israelis and Palestinians should resolve the core issues of their conflict. This is not the path to peace.”
