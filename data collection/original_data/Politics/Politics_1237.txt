 All three Democratic presidential candidates are expected to attend a dinner in Las Vegas on Wednesday hosted by the Nevada State Democratic Party and Senator Harry Reid, the minority leader. Hillary Clinton, Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Martin O’Malley are scheduled to deliver speeches at the “Battle Born/Battleground First in the West Caucus Dinner.” The sold-out event will not feature debates between the candidates and aims to let the candidates make their case for support, organizers said. Nevada will hold a caucus, and it will be third in the nominating process to vote, after Iowa and New Hampshire. “It’s a unique opportunity for them to have an audience with a lot of Democratic voters in the state and nationwide to talk about their plans to grow the middle class, to protect Medicare and Social Security, how they are going to create jobs and address college affordability,” said Zach Hudson, communications director for the Nevada State Democratic Party. “We are pretty confident that we will have a substantive, adult conversation from each candidate.” Mr. Hudson added that the event was aimed at raising awareness about the caucus, the power of the state’s increasingly diverse electorate and the growing political influence of the western part of the United States. Mr. Reid, in a statement, echoed Mr. Hudson. “Nevada is a newer caucus state, and, as it was in 2008, it will be competitive,” Mr. Reid said. “I fought for Nevada as an early state because it reflects the diversity that makes our nation great.” About 1,500 people are expected to attend the $125-a-seat event.  The candidates will make further use of their time in the state this week. Before the dinner Mrs. Clinton will attend an organizing event in Henderson and tour the Culinary Academy of Las Vegas. Mr. Sanders is scheduled to hold a rally Wednesday afternoon. Mr. O’Malley plans to deliver a speech before the Economic Club of Las Vegas on Thursday morning.
