 Negative advertising has been raining down on Donald J. Trump from his opponents, from super PACs, from issue groups. Now, through a digital ad campaign, the Democratic National Committee is joining the fray. “We’re going to be shifting our focus more toward Donald Trump,” said Eric Walker, the deputy communications director for the D.N.C. “We’re not going to be caught flat-footed like the Republican campaigns who made the mistake of not taking Donald Trump seriously.” The group is easing into it, beginning with an online-only ad that it will be targeting on Facebook to voters in Florida, Ohio and North Carolina, which all have primaries next Tuesday, with a sarcastic, trolling video playing off the lawsuits and reports surrounding Trump University.  “Trump University, yes, we have run into some hiccups,” a smug, faux official from Trump University says, before cutting to a negative ad from Our Principles PAC, an anti-Trump Republican super PAC. He then continues: “But we are offering a new program: how to run for president like Donald Trump.” The ad also takes shots at Senators Marco Rubio of Florida and Ted Cruz of Texas, although it is mostly Mr. Trump who gets the brunt of the belittling. It is the first of a three-part digital series with a Trump University theme, the D.N.C. said. The next video, to be released later this month, will feature a fake Trump University fraternity pledge, and the final installment will be the “graduation.” With Mr. Trump continuing to win states, the D.N.C. thought it was time to strategize against him, although it said it would continue to pay attention to the other candidates still in the race. The Republican National Committee, for its part, has been hammering Hillary Clinton, the Democratic front-runner, with negative online videos for months. A spokeswoman from the Trump campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
