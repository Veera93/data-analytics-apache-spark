 Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont plans to travel to New York this weekend to appear on “Saturday Night Live,” interrupting his campaign in New Hampshire for some national television exposure, according to a senior campaign official. Larry David, who has played the senator several times on the show to wide acclaim, will host  the episode and interview Mr. Sanders. The visit comes as Mr. Sanders is seeking to notch his first victory of the nominating contest in New Hampshire, where he holds a comfortable lead in polls over Hillary Clinton. Mrs. Clinton and Donald J. Trump have already appeared on “S.N.L.” during the campaign. Mrs. Clinton appeared in October alongside her comedic doppelgänger Kate McKinnon, who played Mrs. Clinton nursing a “scalding hot vodka” at a dive bar as she overhears people talking about voting for Mr. Trump; the actual Mrs. Clinton was behind the bar, pretending to be a regal bartender and neutral observer in a pressed white dress shirt with the name “Val.” In November, Mr. Trump played a presidential candidate with two well-coiffed doppelgängers who tried to outboast him. Mr. David also loudly heckled Mr. Trump and called him a “racist” from off stage. To mark Mr. Sanders’s appearance, “Saturday Night Live” tweeted out  a brief video of Mr. David doing his Sanders imitation. — Saturday Night Live (@nbcsnl) February 4, 2016
