 Hoping to sway undecided voters in Iowa, a conservative group has issued grades to the candidates, which it says are based on who is “the most effective and principled leader.”  The group, a PAC, is the political arm of the Leadership Project for America, which is focused on electing someone who can govern. The group’s chief executive officer, Paul Mero, said in an interview that the idea was to change how caucusgoers who were still weighing their choices look at the candidates. The PAC will use social media to highlight the grades and to try to affect the views of more than 100,000 likely caucusgoers. Their “issues matrix” includes the devotion to “American exceptionalism,” but also the viability of candidacy. The grades were somewhat surprising. Senator Marco Rubio of Florida received an “A-,” while Donald J. Trump got an “F.” And Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, who has been vying for first place against Mr. Trump in polls, earned a B+.
