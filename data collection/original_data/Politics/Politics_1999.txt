 Donna Shalala, the president of the Clinton Foundation who suffered a stroke on Tuesday shortly after the charity’s annual fall event ended in Manhattan, has “made great progress” and faces a good prognosis, according to an email sent to staff members.  The email from Bruce Lindsey, the chairman of the foundation’s board, was sent just before 7 p.m. on Wednesday “I’m so pleased to be able to share the reassuring news that Donna has made great progress since last night and her condition continues to improve,” Mr. Lindsey wrote. “As of this afternoon, Donna’s in good spirits and her doctors say her prognosis is very good. Donna is grateful for the outpouring of love and support. While she is focused on a swift recovery and getting back to work, her doctors have advised that the most important thing for her now is rest.” Officials with the foundation would not disclose where Ms. Shalala, 74, is being treated.  But after surgery on Tuesday, she was said to be conversing with former President Bill Clinton, in whose administration she served as secretary of health and human services.  Ms. Shalala, the former president of the University of Miami, joined the Clinton Foundation in May.
