 More than 8.5 million people watched the second Democratic presidential debate on CBS on Saturday night, according to Nielsen data provided by the network. After the deadly attacks in Paris on Friday, CBS News focused ​its early ​questions on issues of terrorism, national security and foreign relations. The television audience was substantially smaller than the one for the first Democratic debate, last month on CN​​N, which drew more than 15 million people on a Tuesday night. ​This was the first debate to air on a weekend night, which typically draws smaller audiences. The event nevertheless ranked as the top prime-time broadcast Saturday in total viewers.
​
Saturday night’s debate in Des Moines was​ also​ the first on a broadcast network this campaign season. CBS News worked with its local affiliate, KCCI, The Des Moines Register and Twitter.  The Republican debates drew more than 23 million viewers for each of the first two, on Fox News and CNN, about 14 million for the one on CNBC and 13.5 million for the one on Fox Business Network ​last​ Tuesday. CBS also provided live streaming of the debate and drew 1.2 million connections.
