 That was a quick draft effort.  The Committee to Draft Speaker Ryan for President, created by a group of New York political consultants and financed by Earle Mack, a real estate developer and former ambassador to Finland, is shutting down.  The move came days after aides to Representative Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin, the Republican speaker of the House and Mitt Romney’s vice-presidential running mate in 2012, denounced the committee and disavowed it in a letter to the Federal Election Commission.  “The committee was not sanctioned or in any way inspired by the speaker, his team or allies,” read a statement from the group. “Nor was this, as it was incorrectly described in some media reports, an ‘establishment’ effort to oppose any candidate currently running for president.”  “It’s become increasingly clear that the committee’s efforts, however well intended, could become an unwanted distraction to the speaker’s current responsibilities,” the statement said. “As a result, the committee is immediately ending its activities and closing down operations.”  In an interview when the committee was formed in early March, Mr. Mack said he planned to spend up to $1 million of his own money on the effort. It was not intended as an effort to stop Donald J. Trump from getting the nomination, he said. But he feared that the candidates now running had all been scarred by the negative tone of the race so far and would face an uphill climb against the Democratic nominee in the general election.  Despite how the speaker’s aides felt about the existence of the committee, Zack Roday, a spokesman for Mr. Ryan, sounded a magnanimous note now that it is ending.  “Speaker Ryan is grateful for Ambassador Mack’s passion. He cares deeply about the future of our country,” he said. “Speaker Ryan does too, and that’s why he is focused on advancing a bold policy agenda with his House colleagues to unify our party and turn around our country.”
