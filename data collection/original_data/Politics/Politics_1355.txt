 Congress hopes to wrap up its work for the year on Friday with final passage of a $1.1 trillion spending bill that will fully fund the government through September. Given some opposition from both the left and the right, House leaders were carefully counting votes to make sure they could pass the measure and avoid embarrassment. But the White House expressed its support in a statement, praising Congress for keeping the 2,000-page measure incorporating 12 different spending bills “largely free of new, unrelated ideological riders.” And there were plenty of provisions, such as aid for 9/11 first responders, to attract bipartisan support. If the House approves the measure in a vote scheduled for early Friday, the Senate will take it up alongside a related tax bill in hopes of sending the package to the White House by the end of the day. Senators on Thursday locked in a series of votes to do just that, and to close the door on opponents of the measure who might want to try to drag out the proceedings. One of the side issues in the House is whether the new speaker, Paul D. Ryan, can get a majority of House Republicans — more than 123 — to vote for the spending measure and to abide by the informal Hastert rule requiring a majority of the majority. One of the chief conservative complaints about former Speaker John A. Boehner was that he was willing to move crucial spending bills such as this one with majority Democratic support. But Mr. Ryan has made nice with House conservatives in the early stages of his tenure and they seem willing to give him a pass on this bill, seeing the legislative pile-up and backroom deal-making as a final remnant of the Boehner era. Mr. Ryan has pledged to do better next year. So on to 2016!
