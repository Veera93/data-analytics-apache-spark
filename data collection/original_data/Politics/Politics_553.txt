 Weeks of attacks from his opponents and “super PACs” are taking a toll on Donald J. Trump’s popularity, according to a new ABC News/Washington Post poll that shows his Republican rivals slowly gaining on him. The national survey finds that 34 percent of Republican voters hope Mr. Trump wins the party’s nomination, while 25 percent back Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, 18 percent support Senator Marco Rubio of Florida and 13 percent are pulling for Gov. John Kasich of Ohio. The poll’s margin of error is plus or minus six percentage points. While Mr. Trump continues to top the field, his support has sagged since peaking in December, while the popularity of his opponents has been growing. The poll comes amid a heated primary fight that could lead to a contested convention in Cleveland starting on July 18 if none of the Republicans are able to secure 1,237 delegates. There are some signs of trouble ahead for Mr. Trump as the field continues to winnow. He lags in one-on-one matchups with both Mr. Cruz and Mr. Rubio, suggesting that doubts about his candidacy within the party run deep. And Mr. Trump trails his two leading opponents with female voters and on questions of honesty, empathy and temperament to be president. The prospect of a contested convention is also dividing Republicans. Among those who would not be satisfied with the Manhattan businessman being the nominee, 43 percent would favor party leaders stepping in to prevent his nomination, while 51 percent would opposed such a move. Mr. Trump said on Tuesday in an interview with Fox News that he thinks the candidate with the most delegates should be the nominee and that overruling the will of voters would be unfair.
