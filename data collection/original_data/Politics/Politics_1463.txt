 The House is set on Tuesday to make its second major statement on national security changes in the aftermath of recent terrorist attacks by tightening aspects of the visa waiver program that, if certain conditions are met, eases entry into the United States for citizens of 38 countries. House leaders seemed so confident that the measure would draw strong bipartisan support that they put it on the calendar for expedited approval requiring two-thirds support. The move comes after the House last month approved a much more contentious measure putting new restrictions on accepting refugees from the conflicts in Syria and Iraq. The two bills are linked by more than just national security concerns. Congressional leaders are hoping that quickly advancing the changes in the visa program, which many consider a greater vulnerability than the refugee program, will diminish calls to add tough anti-refugee language to the looming year-end spending package by giving lawmakers an antiterror win.   Under the House bill, visitors from qualifying nations who have been in Syria and Iraq during the previous five years would not be able to participate in the waiver program. Other high-risk nations could also be added to the list and other restrictions and records checks would be imposed as well. The travel industry backs the measure. A bipartisan group of senators led by Dianne Feinstein, Democrat of California, and Jeff Flake, Republican of Arizona, has introduced a bill that would impose more stringent new requirements, including additional fingerprinting. But there was a growing consensus on Monday that the Senate would be willing to accept the House measure to speed approval of the new restrictions.
