 It’s a case of the billionaire versus the “BULLYionaire.” Mike Fernandez, one of Jeb Bush‘s wealthiest donors, announced plans on Friday to buy full-page advertisements warning voters against being lured by Donald J. Trump‘s hateful message and comparing his rise to the conditions that led to some of history’s most evil dictators. “Look at Hitler in Germany, Mussolini in Italy and Peron in Argentina,” Mr. Fernandez writes in the ad, which was first reported by Politico. “When people lose hope, they are susceptible to those who offer to think for them.” Mr. Fernandez is chairman of MBF Healthcare Partners, a private equity firm based in Florida. A billionaire who has donated $3 million to Mr. Bush’s cause, Mr. Fernandez emigrated to the United States from Cuba and has become increasingly concerned about Mr. Trump’s candidacy. Those fears were confirmed on Friday as a new national poll from CNN/ORC showed Mr. Bush’s support among Republicans falling to just 3 percent, while Mr. Trump’s support rose to 36 percent. Mr. Fernandez is the biggest donor to Right to Rise, Mr. Bush’s “super PAC,” and the group has been weighing how to jump start the former Florida governor’s flagging campaign less than two months before the Iowa caucuses in Feb. 1. In this case, Mr. Fernandez is taking matters into his own hands with the advertising effort in which he describes Mr. Trump as a “destroyer” and a “demagogue.” Calling upon voters to look beyond Mr. Trump’s sales pitch, he writes: “See the ‘hater’ for what he is — an insecure, narcissistic BULLYionaire with a hunger to be adored.”
