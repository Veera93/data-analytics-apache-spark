 Hillary Clinton will join Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont at a town hall event hosted by Fox News on Monday night in Detroit, the network announced. Bret Baier, the Fox News anchor who will host the event, announced the agreement on his 6 p.m. show on Friday, breaking into his broadcast with an alert. “Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton has agreed to participate in our Monday town hall in Detroit,” Mr. Baier said during his “Special Report” show. “We’ll have all of the details of that coming up.” It will be Mrs. Clinton’s first appearance on Fox News in two years, according to a release sent by the network. Her campaign initially said she would not be able to make the event, citing travel restrictions, but on Friday reversed course. The town hall event comes just one day before the Michigan Democratic primary and will feature questions both from Mr. Baier and from Michigan voters. The town hall event with Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Sanders will be broadcast at 6 p.m. Eastern time and air again at 11 p.m. Eastern time.
