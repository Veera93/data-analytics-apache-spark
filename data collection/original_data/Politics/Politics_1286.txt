 When Senator Marco Rubio of Florida was the majority whip of the state’s House of Representatives, he used his influence to help his brother-in-law obtain a real estate license after his release from prison, where he had been serving time for trafficking cocaine, according to report.  In a letter obtained by The Washington Post, Mr. Rubio recommended that the Florida Division of Real Estate grant a license to Orlando Cicilia, the husband of his sister. “I have known Mr. Cicilia for over 25 years,” Mr. Rubio wrote on official stationery in 2002. “I recommend him for licensure without reservation.”  The document sheds new light on Mr. Rubio’s ties to an ex-convict and the ways that he wielded power as a rising political star in Florida. Mr. Cicilia, who according to The Post still lives in the same home as Mr. Rubio’s mother, was convicted in 1989 of distributing $15 million worth of cocaine. He spent nearly 12 years in federal prison, and the proceeds from his drug sales were never accounted for. Mr. Rubio made no mention of his personal relationship with Mr. Cicilia in the letter of recommendation, and he has avoided answering questions about their relationship during his presidential campaign. Mr. Cicilia has attended some of Mr. Rubio’s campaign events and his sons have been paid for work associated with his political operations over the years, The Post reported.  The Rubio campaign dismissed suggestions that Mr. Rubio did anything unethical and said that Mr. Cicilia’s legal problems were behind him. “Orlando made some very big mistakes almost 30 years ago, served his time, and has paid his debt to society,” Todd Harris, an adviser to Mr. Rubio’s campaign, told The Post in an email. “Today he is a private citizen, husband and father, simply trying to make a living.”
