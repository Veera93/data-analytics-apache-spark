 Eager to demonstrate urgency and vigor in his campaign, Jeb Bush seems to be testing a new tool: gentle profanity. At least three times in recent days, Mr. Bush has let fly a “damn,” or some variation, to enliven remarks on the stump during his “Jeb Can Fix It” tour in New Hampshire and Florida. “We’re Americans, damn it!” he shouted on Tuesday, admiring the national moxie at a barbecue in Rye, N.H. “A president has to roll up their damn sleeves and get to work,” he told voters in Raymond, N.H., hours later. “We’re going to win this damn thing,” he said the day before in Tampa, Fla. His prepared remarks had called for the drowsier “we will win this campaign.” When a Boston Globe reporter wrote on Twitter that Mr. Bush’s new slogan seemed to be “Damn, Jeb!” the campaign offered only a modest tweak. “Believe it’s ‘Jeb can fix it, damn it,’” said Tim Miller, Mr. Bush’s communications director.
