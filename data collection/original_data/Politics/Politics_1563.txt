Mr. Trump caused a stir Thursday night when he was asked by an NBC reporter if all Muslims should have to register with the federal government and replied: “They have to be.”  When pressed on how such a database would work, he said that people would have to sign up in different places and that it would be an issue of management. On Friday, he took to Twitter to distance himself from the idea. — Donald J.
