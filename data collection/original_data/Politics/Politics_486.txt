 If the polls showing Donald J. Trump well ahead in Florida are accurate, one of those he will have to thank in victory will be Susie Wiles, the campaign manager in 2010 for the state’s governor, Rick Scott. Ms. Wiles lent credibility to Mr. Trump’s candidacy when she was named the state co-chairwoman of his campaign  in October. A Jacksonville political consultant, she recalled that Mr. Trump had asked her to help introduce him to the state’s voters. With a relatively small team, Ms. Wiles played a pivotal role in giving Mr. Trump a toehold with activists and party figures.  “As a card-carrying member of the G.O.P. establishment, many thought my full-throated endorsement of the Trump candidacy was ill advised — even crazy,” Ms. Wiles said in an email about her unpaid role with the campaign.  While Mr. Scott has declined to endorse Mr. Trump, he wrote a glowing op-ed piece about the real-estate magnate in USA Today several weeks ago. And Mr. Scott’s candidacy in 2010, the first broad year of the Tea Party wave, was a prototype for the Trump candidacy — one led by a businessman and outsider whom the establishment had fought hard to beat.  Polls have consistently shown Mr. Trump leading in Florida, despite the fact that the establishment favorite, Marco Rubio, is the state’s junior senator. Mr. Rubio was also elected in 2010, as the insurgent candidate against the establishment pick, Gov. Charlie Crist.
