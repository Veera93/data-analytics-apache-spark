 Donald J. Trump’s comments on illegal immigration, which have drawn criticism and cost his businesses endorsement deals, are now being used to fire up Latin American soccer fans.  In a digital ad released on Monday, TyC Sports, an Argentinian sports station, spliced together Mr. Trump’s controversial statements with highlights of the country’s soccer team to hype the upcoming Copa America tournament, which will be held for the first time in the United States.  — TyC Sports (@TyCSports) May 2, 2016   “We’re having people coming in through the border that are not people we want,” Mr. Trump says, as the Argentinian national team deplanes clad in suits and carrying duffel bags.  The streets fill with fans clad in the white and sky blue — La Albiceleste — of Argentina while Mr. Trump worries about the “hundreds of thousands” coming in through the border.  As Angel di Maria, a forward on the team, rips a blistering near post goal, Mr. Trump describes “these people” as “killers.”  A glaring Lionel Messi, who, at 5 feet 7 inches, is considered one of the world’s best players, looks off into the distance as Mr. Trump says: “These are not the sweet little people that you’d think, O.K.?”  An angelic chorus builds and the highlights reel through, Mr. Trump’s worry continues to grow, before the ad cuts to black, and proclaims, through a translation: The truth is, the best they can do is not let us in. The Copa America tournament, which will be played in cities across the United States, kicks off June 3rd with a match between the United States and Colombia. Argentina plays on June 6th.
