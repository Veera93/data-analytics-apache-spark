 Hillary Rodham Clinton’s press shop, the focal point of her campaign over the summer as she tried to grapple with questions about her use of private email while at the State Department, is adding staff members and reshuffling existing personnel as it prepares for the final months of the nominating contest  and the general election. Such changes in a communications staff during a presidential race aren’t uncommon. But they speak to an urgent need: Mrs. Clinton’s communications team is arguably the most overworked unit on the campaign. Zac Petkanas, a former communications director for Harry Reid and the liberal watchdog Media Matters, will join the campaign as the new director of rapid response, a campaign aide confirmed. The person currently doing that job, Christina Reynolds, a veteran of opposition research, will be promoted and given the title of deputy communications director, the aide said. She will become the second person with that title; the other is Kristina Schake. Josh Schwerin, who has been handling issues related to campaign finance as well as rapid response, will formally become Mr. Petkanas’s deputy. Among the biggest changes has been the departure of Diane Hamwi, a longtime aide to Mrs. Clinton who had been handling some of the duties related to surrogates, an area for which the campaign has come under some criticism from its supporters. (Surrogates are prominent supporters who use their influence to promote the candidate, often making media appearances on the candidate’s behalf.) Adrienne Elrod, a well-respected communications aide who worked on Mrs. Clinton’s 2008 race, is being promoted to head of surrogate operations, the campaign aide said.
