 Senator Marco Rubio’s newest financial backer not only bankrolls his own super PAC, but also writes its TV ads. John Jordan, the California-based winery owner who had been a supporter of Gov. Scott Walker of Wisconsin, is the backer behind a new “super PAC,” Baby Got Pac, which intends to now promote the Florida senator.  The group aired a 60-second ad one time before the Fox Business Network debate on Tuesday night. In the ad, a narrator says that Democrats have made it clear which candidate Republicans should support, citing statements from Democrats in which they have openly fretted about Mr. Rubio’s candidacy.  The spot was produced by Rick Wilson, a Florida-based ad man who has worked for candidates like former Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani of New York when he was running for the Senate in 2000. Mr. Wilson has been a frequent presence on cable television news shows recently, criticizing Donald J. Trump but also, sometimes, Jeb Bush, Mr. Rubio’s Florida rival.  In an interview, Mr. Jordan said he co-wrote the spot with Mr. Wilson, and that the ad “kind of speaks for itself — who do you want on that stage come general election time?”  Mr. Bush, he said, is a “nice man from a good family. He did a good job. The times have passed him by.”  He added that Mr. Bush’s team had not made much of a push to get his support early in the process. He also said that the first spot was an “initial investment.” He suggested there are other ads that may run.  “I’m trying to stay fluid,” he said.  But his support gives Mr. Rubio another bit of support from someone with deep pockets, as he tries to pull donors away from Mr. Bush in the primary.
