 Right to Rise, the “super PAC” supporting Jeb Bush’s candidacy, has created its first negative ad of the cycle, attacking Donald J. Trump, Senator Marco Rubio and Senator Ted Cruz.  The ad is part of an initial $3.7 million buy over the next week that was paired with another ad supporting Mr. Bush.  Titled “Desk,” the ad trades on fear of terrorism, focusing on the desk in the Oval Office.  “When the attacks come here, the person behind this desk will have to protect your family,” the ad intones.  It then makes individual criticisms of the three candidates. It calls Mr. Trump “impulsive and reckless,” accuses Mr. Cruz of weakening counterterrorism surveillance, and accuses Mr. Rubio of skipping “crucial national security hearings and votes just to campaign.” (Mr. Rubio has defended his attendance record, saying “voting is not the only part of a Senate job.”) The ad then promotes “27 generals and admirals” who support Mr. Bush’s candidacy.  The timing of Right to Rise’s first negative ad is fortuitous. It comes on the heels of Mr. Trump’s escalating oratory in which he called for a “complete shutdown of Muslims entering the country,” a plan that was nearly unanimously denounced by his Republican rivals, making Right to Rise one of the first to advertise off that sentiment.  And it also comes only 24 hours after President Obama delivered a rare speech from the Oval Office on confronting the Islamic State, a speech Mr. Bush criticized repeatedly.  The ad will begin running on Tuesday in the four early-voting states and nationally on Fox News.
