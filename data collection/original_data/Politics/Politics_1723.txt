 Representative Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin begins his first full week as speaker of the House as lawmakers try to settle down after last week’s leadership transition and approval of the budget and debt-limit deal. The big action in the House will be the consideration of a six-year, $325 billion highway and infrastructure measure as lawmakers look for a long-term resolution to a problem that has tied them in knots for years. The existing highway program last week was granted its 35th temporary extension since 2009 — until Nov. 20. The time is intended to allow the House and Senate a chance to work out a way to pay for a program that is a prime source of well-paying jobs and transportation improvements around the nation. State officials say the persistent uncertainty has made it difficult for them to plan for much-needed work. But a few potholes are ahead. Neither the House nor a Senate bill approved in July have funding for the full program, so negotiators will have to smooth out that little wrinkle. And the final bill could be the vehicle to renew the Export-Import Bank, which many House conservatives oppose. So Mr. Ryan could face early tests on a measure that everyone agrees is long overdue. When the House convenes on Monday, it will be the first time since 1991 that John A. Boehner is not a member. His retirement became official just before midnight on Saturday. A special election will need to be held in Ohio to find his successor.
