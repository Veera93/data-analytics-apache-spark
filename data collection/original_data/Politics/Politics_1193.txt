 Ted Cruz is on a six-day, 28-town swing through Iowa. These are the places, faces and culinary selections of 2016’s first proper bus tour. EVENT 20 Time: 2:01 p.m., Jan. 8 Place: Osage, Iowa (population: 3,619) Site: Teluwut Grille House &amp; Pub, stuffed with T-shirts and assorted images of adult beverages. Mood: monkey-business casual Food: breaded broccoli, loaded criss cuts, hog wild wings Emotionally conflicted sign: “Do one brave thing a day … and then run like hell” Ominous sign: “If these walls could talk  …” Highlight: An attendee, capping an occasionally profane preface, asked Mr. Cruz if he had “the brass ones” to effect change. The crowd roared. “I want to thank you for what is officially the most colorful question we’ve had on the bus tour,” Mr. Cruz said. “I have to say, it’s hard to know where to start.” After some well-worn stump-speech fodder, Mr. Cruz got around to his central thought: In the Republican race, he suggested, no one could match him “when it comes to strength of spine, or other body parts.”
