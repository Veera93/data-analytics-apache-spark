 Ahead of tax day on Monday, an unlikely pair in the Senate has teamed up on a proposal to encourage American taxpayers to salt away “rainy day” funds, by allowing them to defer up to 20 percent of any refund due from the Internal Revenue Service.  The senators, Cory Booker, Democrat of New Jersey, and Jerry Moran, Republican of Kansas, share little ideological turf. But in introducing their proposed legislation, the Refund to Rainy Day Savings Act, the senators said on Wednesday that they each recognized the difficulty their constituents can face in saving for a potential emergency, whether they live in Trenton or Topeka, Kan.  “Millions of Americans are getting by with little or no money set aside to cover unexpected costs,” Mr. Booker said in a statement. “Families living paycheck to paycheck endure the persistent threat of sudden financial disaster.”  Mr. Moran, who is running for re-election to a second term, said: “Setting aside enough money each payday can be difficult when dollars are already stretched and existing expenses must be paid. This bipartisan legislation would allow Americans to utilize a rare moment of financial flexibility that accompanies a tax refund to plan for the future.”  The senators’ proposal would allow the 80 percent of American taxpayers who are due a refund each year to defer receiving up to 20 percent of that money until six months after their initial refund is approved. To participate in the program, taxpayers must receive their refund by direct deposit. The Treasury Department would hold the rainy-day funds and pay them out with interest. Participants could request to receive their money as early as 30 days after initial payment of their refund.
