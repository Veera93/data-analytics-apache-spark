 Sarah Huckabee, the daughter of Mike Huckabee — the former governor of Arkansas and two-time presidential candidate — joined Donald J. Trump’s presidential campaign this week as a senior adviser, giving Mr. Trump a toehold in Arkansas, one of 12 states that are holding nominating contests on Super Tuesday.  Ms. Huckabee has long been one of her father’s top advisers. He won the Iowa caucuses in the 2008 presidential race, but failed to gain traction this year as Mr. Trump galvanized voters with the same populist message that Mr. Huckabee used.  Mr. Huckabee has not endorsed a candidate yet, but his daughter’s presence on the Trump campaign will send a signal. “I have great respect for Governor Mike Huckabee, and we have a mutual admiration for our wonderful families,” Mr. Trump said in a statement Thursday. In an accompanying statement, Ms. Huckabee offered a validation of Mr. Trump, who used to support abortion rights, as a social conservative.  “Like the other Republican candidates, Mr. Trump is pro-life, pro-marriage, and will appoint conservatives to the courts,” Ms. Huckabee said. “What makes Mr. Trump my choice for president is he will break the grip of the donor class on our government and make it accountable to working families again.”  Senator Ted Cruz of Texas could also do well in Arkansas on Tuesday. Mr. Trump is looking to gather enough delegates in states such as Alabama and Massachusetts, where polls show him having a large lead, that he becomes virtually unstoppable in securing the Republican nomination.  On Wednesday, Mr. Trump secured his first two congressional endorsements, including Representative Chris Collins of New York, who had been supporting Jeb Bush but said on MSNBC that he had been drifting toward Mr. Trump for weeks.
