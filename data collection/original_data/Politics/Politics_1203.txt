 BURLINGTON, Vt. — It was about half an hour into Donald Trump’s speech that the police here made it official: No one else in line, which still snaked around the block, was getting in.  “This is soul-crushing,” said Akiva Nugent, 15, who was standing near the front of the line with a group of his friends.  There seemed to be about 200 people still behind them, including Torrey Aloard, 40, the owner of a landscaping company here. Mr. Aloard had bought a hat and two buttons to support the campaign, as well as an American flag scarf to ward off the cold, while he stood in line.  “This may be chaos, but at least he got here,” said Mr. Aloard, who is planning to vote for Mr. Trump. He added, “not a lot of candidates usually bother to stop in Vermont.” Meanwhile, some demonstrators danced to a brass band and others cheered each time people left the venue, apparently anticipating that they were protesters who had interrupted the proceedings inside.
