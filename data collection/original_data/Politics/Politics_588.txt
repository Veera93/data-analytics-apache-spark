 Donald J. Trump abruptly pulled out of a heavily hyped speaking slot on Saturday at the Conservative Political Action Conference in Maryland, saying he will instead visit Kansas, a caucus state in which Senator Ted Cruz is expected to perform well in voting that day.  Mr. Trump will hold a rally and visit a caucus site in Kansas, then head to Florida, his spokeswoman said in a statement. “Because of this, he will not be able to speak at CPAC as he has done for many consecutive years,” said the spokeswoman, Hope Hicks, adding that he will return next year “hopefully as president of the United States.” Both “Wichita” and “Kansas” were misspelled in the Trump statement. The last-minute cancellation at the grass-roots conservative event was not met well.  — CPAC (@CPAC) March 4, 2016  It was becoming clear that attendees at the conference were mixed about the presence of Mr. Trump, who has appeared with the group before but whose front-runner status for the Republican nomination has splintered the party.
