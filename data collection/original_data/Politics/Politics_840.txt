 HAMPSTEAD, N.H. — Chris Christie knows Tuesday is a big day that could very well decide the fate of his presidential campaign. But in the final hours before the primary here, he is resisting saying specifically what would make the day a success. “I’ll know it when I see it,” he told reporters as he squeezed his way out of a packed coffee house here. Asked if a good day would mean finishing fourth or fifth, Mr. Christie repeated, “I’ll know it when I see it.” Last week, the New Jersey governor predicted that New Hampshire voters would sharply narrow the field. And on Monday, he was still speaking as if he planned to be part of that smaller group going onto the next round. “I don’t think there’s anything make or break about tomorrow, but it is very important and I’m going to do very well, so we’ll just be talking about South Carolina after tomorrow,” he said. Still, a little while earlier, when a New Hampshire woman three rows back at the coffeehouse told Mr. Christie that he was in her top two, the governor sounded as if he was ready to leap through the crowd to make his case, underscoring the value that candidates are putting on single votes on this crucial final day. “I may just climb over these people,” he said. As he began his talk, Mr. Christie struck a note of urgency, pointing out that there were only 32 hours until the polls closed. This, he proclaimed, is the “Christmas Eve of politics.” To get to the event, Mr. Christie had battled not only heavy snow but protesters who waited outside his bus and then stood in the window as he spoke. Arriving a few minutes late, he apologized for the weather delay but not for the presence of critics, who he assumed were Democrats from his home state who had followed him. “I miss my people so much,” he joked, noting how it had been about two weeks since he was in New Jersey to tend to a blizzard. He said he did not mind the protests, a reminder of the heat of politics.  “I love those people out the window,” he said.
