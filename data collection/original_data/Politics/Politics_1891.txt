 Hillary Rodham Clinton turned to the president of the union who had just endorsed her in Nevada on Wednesday and said, “I’m feeling really lucky in Las Vegas.” And while she was clearly kidding – Mrs. Clinton would surely attribute her well-received debate performance to much more than luck – her campaign seems to be feeling like it is on a little bit of a Vegas roll. Aside from positive feedback from her debate performance, the campaign also saw her chief rival for the Democratic nomination, Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, criticize the inquiries into her emails. She picked up a union endorsement, from the International Union of Painters and Allied Trades, and she is flying overnight to Texas to receive the endorsement of Julián Castro, the former mayor of San Antonio and the current secretary of Housing and Urban Development. And none are more pleased with the moment than the candidate herself. Mrs. Clinton made an unscheduled stop at La Flor de Michoacan, an ice cream shop in North Las Vegas, trying a number of flavors before settling on a lime ice. She wandered the shop, joking and laughing with Nelson Araujo, a state assemblyman who accompanied her there. Then she moved outside, where she aw-ed over a baby and posed for several pictures, including one with a Chihuahua. And before she bounded on the stage at her night rally in an amphitheater just off the Vegas Strip, a mariachi band played two upbeat, up-tempo songs before a choir led the crowd in a rendition of “Lean on Me,” the same song Mrs. Clinton sang during her recent “Saturday Night Live” performance. “It is so good to be here with all of you,” Mrs. Clinton said as she took the stage, talking through the extended cheers and asking “Did we have a good debate last night?” Then she paused, smiled and let the cheers answer.
