 The Senate returns on Monday to a political environment considerably changed from when they left 10 days ago for the holiday break. The death of Justice Antonin Scalia and President Obama’s stated intention to nominate a replacement have injected a volatile new element into the Senate just as Republicans and Democrats were trying to work together to pass bipartisan legislation on criminal justice, energy policy and an escalating drug crisis. Now the bitter dispute over whether Senate Republicans are willing to even take up the nomination is likely to spill over into the other items on the Senate agenda, as both sides eye each other warily. While they cannot force the nomination through, given their minority status, Democrats believe they have the upper hand politically, with Republicans forced to defend their position not to act even though Mr. Obama has almost 11 months remaining in his term. But Republicans believe they would face a backlash from their conservative base if they gave Mr. Obama a final-year chance to reshape the court. One of the first orders of business will be the annual reading of George Washington’s farewell address, in observance of his birthday. In it, he laments the rise of factions and political parties as a threat to the new government’s ability to get things done. “All obstructions to the execution of the laws, all combinations and associations, under whatever plausible character, with the real design to direct, control, counteract or awe the regular deliberation and action of the constituted authorities, are destructive of this fundamental principle, and of fatal tendency,” Washington wrote. “They serve to organize faction, to give it an artificial and extraordinary force; to put, in the place of the delegated will of the nation the will of a party.”
