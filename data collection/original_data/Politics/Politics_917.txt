 Martin O’Malley took out a loan to keep his Democratic presidential campaign afloat late last year, and repaid it with matching funds received in January, according numbers in his campaign filings provided by an aide. Many of his senior and junior aides also have been unpaid since he moved most of them to Iowa, according to the summary provided by his aide. Mr. O’Malley took out a $500,000 line of credit ahead of public matching funds that he had applied for, but couldn’t receive them until this year. His aides kept news of the loan quiet over the last several weeks. He received more than $900,000 in matching funds this month and repaid the loan. He also received another $300,000 in donations. His aides, some of whom have been close to him for years, have continued working for free. He received $1.5 million including the loan, and spent $2.1 million. He has $535,000 in debt and $169,442 in cash on hand.
