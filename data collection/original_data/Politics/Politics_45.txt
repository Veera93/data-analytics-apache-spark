 The tape, without question, is real. The famed recording of Donald J. Trump making vulgar comments about women while filming a segment for “Access Hollywood,” which was first reported by The Washington Post roughly a month before last year’s presidential election, figured prominently in the final stretch of the race. Its authenticity wasn’t challenged at the time. But Mr. Trump suggested to a senator earlier this year that the tape was not authentic, The Times reported on Saturday, and he recently repeated that contention to an adviser. The claim does not hold up to scrutiny. “Let us make this perfectly clear: The tape is very real,” Natalie Morales, an “Access Hollywood” host, said during Monday’s broadcast. “Remember his excuse at the time was ‘locker room talk.’ He said every one of those words.” Hours after the tape was published last October, Mr. Trump directly acknowledged that it was genuine. “I said it, I was wrong and I apologize,” he said in a video recording. Here is the relevant portion of the transcript. Asked on Monday if the president now questioned the authenticity of the tape, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the White House press secretary, said that Mr. Trump had “made his position on that clear.” “The president hasn’t changed his position,” she said. “I think if anything that the president questions, it’s the media’s reporting on that accuracy.” It begins with audio of Mr. Trump speaking with Billy Bush, the former “Access Hollywood” host, on a bus. In the section that attracted the most attention, Mr. Trump referred to kissing women and grabbing them by their genitals without their consent. Here is the full transcript. After the recording was published, Mr. Bush was fired from his job on the “Today” show. He has since apologized and said he hopes to return to television.
