 Congress is in recess this week, but the struggle over the Supreme Court vacancy is not. At least five senators are scheduled to return to Capitol Hill for private sessions with the nominee, Judge Merrick B. Garland. Those sessions will include a meeting with Senator Mark S. Kirk of Illinois, who will be the first Republican to sit down with Judge Garland. Mr. Kirk is perhaps the most endangered Senate Republican up for re-election — and in President Obama’s home state — and he has been among the most critical of his party’s decision not to consider the nomination of Judge Garland. On Monday, the nominee is expected to meet with Senator Joe Donnelly, Democrat of Indiana. Democrats hope the session with Mr. Donnelly will increase pressure on his home-state colleague, Dan Coats, a Republican, to also agree to a meeting with Judge Garland. Last week, Senator Patrick J. Toomey, Republican of Pennsylvania, softened his position on meeting the nominee after his Democratic colleague, Bob Casey, did so. Mr. Toomey, however, is running for re-election; Mr. Coats is leaving the Senate. Others on Judge Garland’s schedule this week include the Democratic senators Benjamin L. Cardin of Maryland on Monday, and Kirsten E. Gillibrand of New York and Al Franken of Minnesota on Wednesday.
