 Like Donald J. Trump, Ben Carson, the retired pediatric neurosurgeon and Republican presidential candidate, has defied the pundits and establishment prognosticators by unapologetically running as a political outsider. A new television ad by the Carson campaign aims to capitalize on his unusual experience and style of campaigning. The 30-second spot, which is airing in the Greenville, S.C., market, features Mr. Carson, in a suit, standing next to an empty cardboard box that says “Washington political class” on one side and  a sketch of the Capitol on another. “I’m Ben Carson and I’m running for president,” he says. “The political class and their pundit buddies say: ‘Impossible. He’s too outside the box.’ Well, they do know impossible. Impossible to balance the budget, impossible to get border security, impossible to put aside partisanship.” He continues: “I’m Ben Carson, I’m running for president, and I’m very much outside the box.” Then, turning to the box, Mr. Carson concludes, “There must be a good idea in there somewhere.” Reached for comment, the Carson campaign said the spot had aired mistakenly a few times, and was not officially scheduled to hit the airwaves for another week or two. But on Friday, Mr. Carson broadcast his first television ad in the first four early nominating states. The “Outside the Box” spot also captures Mr. Carson’s low-key demeanor, which has helped him appeal to voters in Iowa.
