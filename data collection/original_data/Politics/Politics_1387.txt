 Jeb Bush will next hit the campaign trail for a packed day of town-hall-style events in New Hampshire at 8 a.m. Saturday in Contoocook, and finish up nearly 12 hours later in Nashua. Then he will return to the state, again and again. In a sign of how critical Mr. Bush considers New Hampshire, which holds its primary on Feb. 9, his presidential campaign recently started what it is calling “The New Hampshire Project.” The New Hampshire Project is, at its core, a fund-raising push with a goal of raising $1 million by the end of December to buy television ad time in the state. Though Mr. Bush and the “super PAC” supporting him, “Right to Rise,” have both invested in New Hampshire, Mr. Bush remains stuck in the single digits in state polls. (Mr. Bush’s campaign has so far invested over $4 million in New Hampshire television ad buys, though that figure includes future reservations.) The New Hampshire Project officially kicked off last week, with a phone call on Wednesday featuring Jeb Bush Jr., one of Mr. Bush’s sons, and Rich Killion, the campaign’s New Hampshire strategist.
