 LONDONDERRY, N.H. — The men of the Bush family hate being “put on the couch,” their preferred term for dismissing the news media’s attempts to psychoanalyze their political dynasty. But it might be worth bringing in Sigmund Freud for Jeb Bush’s latest remarks. Speaking at a town hall-style event on Thursday, Mr. Bush, unprompted, offered that he loves his mom, Barbara Bush, most of all. “I get asked all the time: ‘Well, are you like your brother? Are you like your dad?’” he said. “I know there’s a real fascination about this. Let’s just — let me get this out of the way: I love my mother more than my dad.” Well, then. But Mr. Bush wasn’t done just yet. “Put aside all the 41 and 43 — who you like, all that stuff that’s a People magazine kind of fascination,” he continued, referring to his father, George Bush, the 41st president, and his brother, George W. Bush, the 43rd president. He ended on a sweet note. “I’m blessed, that’s all I have to tell you,” he said. “I’m blessed to be George and Barbara’s son, and I’m blessed to be George W.’s brother. But the world we’re in today is dramatically different than 2000, when my brother got elected, and 2001, when the World Trade Center towers and the Pentagon and the plane went down in Pennsylvania.” Moments later, a voter asked him a question slightly less fraught with the burden of history — to compare and contrast himself with Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey, one of several more moderate candidates Jeb Bush is battling in New Hampshire.   “Well, I think I’m much better looking,” Mr. Bush quipped, to laughter, before going on to promote his own record in the private sector, then as governor of Florida. When he had finished, nearly seven minutes later, he praised Mr. Christie — “Chris is a great guy” — but concluded, “I don’t think he could give you a record of accomplishment that compares to that.”
