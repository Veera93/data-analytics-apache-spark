 Donald J. Trump’s plan to ban foreign Muslims from entering the United States has received bipartisan condemnation from lawmakers and advocacy groups, but Republicans in general appear to support the idea, according to a national poll released Thursday. An NBC/Wall Street Journal survey found that 57 percent of all those polled opposed Mr. Trump’s idea, with 25 percent supporting it. However, Republicans in the poll were essentially split on the proposal, with 42 percent backing a moratorium on Muslims’ entering the country and 36 percent opposing such a policy.  When looking at just potential Republican primary voters, views were even more sharply divided, with 38 percent for the ban and 39 percent opposed to it. The results show that despite the fact that people around the world have accused Mr. Trump of being a bigot for wanting to bar Muslims, the proposal may not hurt him in the race for the Republican nomination. In fact, it could help. The full poll, which questioned 1,000 adults and had a margin of error of plus or minus three percentage points, found that few Republicans consider Mr. Trump insulting while far more say he is raising important issues and “telling it like it is.” (The question on Mr. Trump’s Muslim proposal had 495 respondents, with a margin of error of plus-minus four percentage points.) The poll also found that more Republicans had an unfavorable view of Muslims — 48 percent, to 43 percent who view them favorably — suggesting that Mr. Trump might not damage himself with voters by demonizing followers of Islam.
