 CNN is broadening its criteria for next monthâ€™s Republican presidential debate, including polling from Iowa and New Hampshire to determine which candidates make the main stage. The cable network said on Friday that candidates will need to have either a national polling average of 3.5 percent or higher, or be polling at 4 percent or higher in Iowa or New Hampshire, to qualify for the prime-time debate, which will be held in Las Vegas on Dec. 15. CNN will consider polls that were conducted from Oct. 29 to Dec. 13. The change comes as networks have faced sharp criticism from candidates, such as Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey, who have been relegated to the so-called undercard debates and those who have been left out entirely, like Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina. They have argued that the focus on national polling undercuts the importance that states like Iowa and New Hampshire, which kick off the caucus and primary voting, are supposed to have in the nominating process. Based on polling from this week, Mr. Christie would make the main stage this time, but Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky is on the fence. CNN will still host an earlier debate featuring candidates with polling averages of at least 1 percent. Wolf Blitzer will moderate the later debate, joined by Dana Bash and Hugh Hewitt.
