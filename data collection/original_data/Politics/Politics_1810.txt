 DES MOINES — A former top aide to Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky was found not guilty in federal court on Thursday of lying to the F.B.I. The former aide, Jesse Benton, had run a “super PAC” supporting Mr. Paul’s presidential campaign until he stepped down in August when he was indicted. The case stemmed from the 2012 presidential run of Mr. Paul’s father, Ron, the former Texas congressman. Mr. Benton, who had been Ron Paul’s national campaign chairman, was accused of misleading a federal investigation into secret payments of $73,000 made to an Iowa state senator in exchange for endorsing Ron Paul. Mr. Benton is married to Ron Paul’s granddaughter. Another top Ron Paul aide from 2012, Dimitri Kesari, was convicted on Thursday of covering up the payments to the Iowa official, Kent Sorenson.  The case has cast a shadow over Rand Paul’s campaign. Testifying in federal court in Des Moines last week, Ron Paul accused prosecutors of bringing the charges to damage his son’s presidential hopes.  “We are pleased to learn that Jesse Benton has been vindicated today of wrongdoing,’’ Roscoe Howard, Mr. Benson’s lawyer, said in a statement.
