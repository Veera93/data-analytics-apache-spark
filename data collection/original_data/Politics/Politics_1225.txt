 Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. often sounded conflicted last year while deciding whether to run for president. Nearly three months after saying he would not begin a campaign, Mr. Biden said his decision still tugged him in two directions.  “I regret it every day,” Mr. Biden, who had run for president twice before, said in an interview with NBC Connecticut, one of a handful he did to support President Obama’s executive actions on gun control. “But it was the right decision for my family and me.” Mr. Biden was emotionally ravaged after his oldest child, Beau, died of brain cancer in May. Mr. Biden, who had left open the possibility of a third campaign of his own after Mr. Obama’s re-election in 2012, began thinking about it in earnest a short time after his son died. But after more than three months of deliberations, Mr. Biden announced on Oct. 21 that he would not run.  A Biden campaign would have pitted him against Hillary Clinton, who leads polls for the Democratic nomination and who also served in the Obama administration, as secretary of state.  “There’s real robust debate between Hillary and Bernie,” Mr. Biden said of Mrs. Clinton and her closest primary challenger, Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, adding, “As there would’ve been if I was in the race.” He said he planned to stay involved in the campaign as it goes forward. Mr. Biden also said that the Republican primary had been a “crazy” race dominated by the comments of Donald J. Trump and Senator Ted Cruz of Texas.
