 Sean Parker, the youthful billionaire and co-founder of the music-sharing service Napster, gave nearly $300,000 to a joint fund-raising committee for Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaign and dozens of state Democratic parties, federal filings show.  Mr. Parker was one of several donors in recent months to give to the Hillary Victory Fund. Others include the media mogul Haim Saban and his wife Cheryl, and the billionaire trader and philanthropist George Soros; all gave more than $300,000. The Chicago-based entrepreneur J.B. Pritzker gave more than $350,000.  The latter donors have been long familiar to Mrs. Clinton. Mr. Parker, by contrast, is relatively new to the world of political giving, having only become a donor in the last several years. He has held meetings with politicians as disparate as Mayor Bill de Blasio of New York and Senator Rand Paul, Republican of Kentucky. He gave to President Obama’s re-election effort in 2012 and also to the immigration reform group FWD.us.  In the joint fund-raising entities, the Clinton campaign has asked major donors to consider giving money, because they face a number of options for gifts to the Democratic candidate that exceed $2,700, the maximum contribution allowed in the primary campaign. One is Priorities USA, the “super PAC”  supporting Mrs. Clinton, which just invested more than $4.5 million in trying to help her in the primary fight against Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont.  The joint fund-raising committee sends $34,500 of a donor’s contribution to the Democratic National Committee and spreads the rest among 33 different state party organizations.
