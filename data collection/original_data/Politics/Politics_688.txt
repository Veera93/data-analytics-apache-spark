 Republican and Democratic senators will gather behind closed doors on Tuesday for their weekly party lunches, and the vacant Supreme Court seat is likely to be a main point of discussion. It will be the first time lawmakers will have been together for strategy sessions since the death of Justice Antonin Scalia. They have plenty to talk about after Monday’s events, when a 1992 floor speech of Joseph R. Biden Jr., then a senator, surfaced, undercutting Democratic demands for consideration of President Obama’s nominee.  That did not stop Senator Harry Reid, the Democratic leader from Nevada, from heaping criticism on Republicans for their plans to block a confirmation. Still, Senator Mitch McConnell, the Kentucky Republican and majority leader, made it clear that he was not backing down from his pledge to keep the court seat open to be filled by the next president. “It’s clear that concern over confirming Supreme Court nominations made near the end of a presidential term is not new,” Mr. McConnell said, in a veiled swipe at Mr. Biden’s 24-year-old declaration that he would oppose confirming a new Supreme Court nominee close to the presidential election. Democrats were not thrilled with the recycling of Mr. Biden’s comments, made when he was the Senate Judiciary Committee chairman. But they believe they can still put Senate Republicans in a very uncomfortable position if they refuse to conduct hearings on an eventual nominee, drawing comfort from public opinion polls that show the majority of Americans on their side.
