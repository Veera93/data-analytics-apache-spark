 Senator Marco Rubio of Florida, who has called Donald J. Trump a con artist, a faux conservative and a failed businessman with an aura of success that is as phony as his tan, insisted Friday that he would vote for Mr. Trump if he became the Republican nominee. Just to be clear about the senator’s antipathy toward Mr. Trump: Mr. Rubio has also said that the New York real estate mogul would rip the Republican Party apart, setting it back decades with voters, and be crushed by Hillary Clinton in a general election. Yet he would still vote for him. Come again?  “Because that’s how bad Hillary Clinton is,” Mr. Rubio said when asked Friday how he could rationalize his position. Mr. Rubio then went on to describe how terrible Mr. Trump was. “The fact that we keep getting asked, ‘Will you vote for the front-runner as a Republican?’ tells you what a flawed candidate he is,” the senator said to reporters in Kansas on Friday. “We don’t want Republicans to have to make excuses for why they have to vote for their nominee. We want them to be excited about their nominee.” Mr. Rubio also seemed to be digesting some of the damage Mr. Trump had done to him in Florida. If Mr. Rubio does not win his home state’s primary on March 15, and its 99 winner-take-all delegates, his campaign is most likely finished.  “Look, it’s going to be close,” he said. “Especially with something like Donald Trump going on and the amount of national attention he’s gotten.” “But we’re going to win Florida,” Mr. Rubio added.
