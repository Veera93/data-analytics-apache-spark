 It’s decision time again for Congress as lawmakers confront a Friday deadline for keeping the government open. House and Senate negotiators have been playing it close to the chest as they try to hash out a $1.1 trillion deal that can attract bipartisan support and fund federal agencies through next September. The main obstacle has been coming to terms on the policy provisions, or “riders,” that will be included in the package. Progress has been slow, and House Republicans say they don’t expect to disclose a bill on Monday, as had been the plan. While lawmakers still expect a House-Senate agreement this week, a short extension of current funding may be needed to wrap things up.  Despite the delays, no one anticipates a government shutdown. The Republican-led Congress just passed a major highway measure after years of failure, and a significant education bill is expected to clear the Senate with broad bipartisan support as early as Tuesday after passing the House last week. Lurching into a shutdown would immediately erase the sense that Congress is finally making some progress — a message Republicans are clearly trying to send heading into 2016. With lawmakers eager to break for the holidays, the chief question for Congress is whether the parties can get together on a major set of business, poverty and health care tax changes before exiting. The outcome for that legislation is the real uncertainty.
