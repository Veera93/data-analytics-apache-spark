 Lo and behold, Congress has delivered a long-term highway bill. It is practically a holiday miracle. House and Senate negotiators came to terms on Tuesday on a five-year highway and mass transit measure that could be approved in both chambers by the end of this week, ending years of stop-and-go extensions that wreaked havoc on road and bridge construction planning around the nation. The $300 billion, five-year bill also resurrects the Export-Import Bank, reviled by many conservatives as corporate welfare but backed by big business. The entire measure is paid for with the help of a series of budget gimmicks that lawmakers acknowledge will have to ultimately be replaced with a more stable way of financing the highway program.  Still, just the fact that the House and Senate could come together in a bipartisan way on a measure that has stymied them for years represented an achievement. House and Senate Republican leaders intend to celebrate approval of that measure and a second on education as evidence that they can find ways to deliver bills that Democrats can also support and that President Obama can sign.   “This is the way things are supposed to happen,” said House Speaker Paul D. Ryan, calling the bills bipartisan victories. “This is regular order. This is the committees doing their jobs, members serving on the conference committees, hammering out an agreement.”
