 Ted Cruz is on a six-day, 28-town swing through Iowa. These are the places, faces and culinary selections of 2016’s first proper bus tour. EVENT 3 Time: 3:36 p.m., Jan. 4 Place: Guthrie Center, Iowa (population: 1,569) Site: Prime Time Restaurant, a bar-and-grill with an exposed brick wall and beer served in mason jars Food: cheddar cheese balls, bam bam jumbo shrimp, Frisco burger Mood: pregame happy hour Art: Painting of a tiger staring menacingly into the distance Attendee admission: Mr. Cruz’s plans to abolish the Internal Revenue Service received an instant endorsement from a man seated beside him during his speech. “I’m getting audited on Wednesday,” the visitor said. Highlight: Mr. Cruz recalled a tantrum from his then-three-year-old daughter Caroline, who had wanted to ride in a car with her friends during a family vacation. That night, after a conversation with her mother, Caroline began to pray. “Dear Jesus,” she said. “Tonight, we had a situation. And I’m not sorry. But it’s not going to happen again.” The anecdote had a point, Mr. Cruz suggested, semi-convincingly: “In those words, it sums up where this country is.”
