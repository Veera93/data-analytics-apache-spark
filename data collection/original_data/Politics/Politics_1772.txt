 President Obama is set to raise money for congressional Democrats at a wealthy donor’s Fifth Avenue home during a trip to New York City next week, according to a person briefed on the event and to an invitation sent to donors. Mr. Obama plans to appear on Monday evening at the home of Jennifer and Jonathan Soros, for an event benefiting the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee. Also expected to attend are Representative Nancy Pelosi of California, the House minority leader, and Representative Ben Ray Luján of New Mexico, who heads the House campaign committee, according to people familiar with the event, who spoke on condition of anonymity because it had not yet been announced. The president was already expected to visit New York and attend a performance of the Broadway show “Hamilton,” as part of a separate fund-raising benefit for the Democratic National Committee.  But Mr. Obama’s event for House Democrats is a boost to the committee’s fund-raising as Democrats seek to climb out of the minority in 2016. Despite the long odds facing the party, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee has already posted formidable financial numbers, collecting $15.2 million in the third quarter of 2016 and outpacing its Republican counterpart, the National Republican Congressional Committee. Mr. Soros, one of the hosts of the event, is a Democratic investor who has been an outspoken advocate for overhauling the campaign finance system. He is a son of George Soros, the billionaire financier who has been closely affiliated with the Democratic Party. An invitation to the event lists the price of entry as $10,000 for individual donors and $33,400 per couple.  A White House spokesman confirmed Mr. Obama’s plans to attend the event and said further details would be forthcoming in the next few days.
