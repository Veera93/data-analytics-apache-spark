 Senator Bernie Sanders is already lining up his post-debate interviews next week, and one of them could keep him on his feet.  Mr. Sanders, the independent from Vermont, will make his debut appearance on “The Ellen DeGeneres Show” next Thursday, two days after the first Democratic presidential debate, in Las Vegas on Oct. 13.  The show gives candidates an opportunity to connect with female voters and have a few laughs. Last month, Hillary Rodham Clinton, whom Mr. Sanders is battling for the nomination, won high marks from fans for dancing the “nae nae.” While Mr. Sanders has proved to be a big draw with younger, progressive voters, he tends to stick to serious policy issues such as campaign finance on the trail. Asked if Mr. Sanders was prepared to show his moves, a spokesman said: “He knows that a little dancing is part of the drill.”
