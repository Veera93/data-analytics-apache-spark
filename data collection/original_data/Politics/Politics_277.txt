 Donald J. Trump holds a double-digit lead in Pennsylvania, according to a new poll that shows moderate Republicans providing him a boost in the state ahead of its primary election later this month. A survey from Monmouth University released on Thursday showed Mr. Trump being supported by 44 percent of likely Republican voters, while Senator Ted Cruz of Texas gets 28 percent and Gov. John Kasich of Ohio garners 23 percent.  Republicans who consider themselves moderate or “somewhat conservative” are buttressing Mr. Trump, while he runs closer with Mr. Cruz among “very conservative” voters. The Manhattan businessman also does best with voters who do not have college degrees. The Republicans have been campaigning aggressively in Pennsylvania and emphasizing their local roots. Mr. Trump reminded voters this week that he was educated at the Wharton School of Finance, in Philadelphia, while Mr. Kasich has been playing up the fact that he was born in the state.  There are 54 Republican delegates at stake in Pennsylvania, but only 17 of them are bound to the candidate who wins the state. The rest are free to back a candidate of their choosing at the Republican convention in Cleveland starting on July 18. “The real question is how the directly elected district delegates will vote at the convention in July,” said Patrick Murray, director of the Monmouth University Polling Institute.  Pennsylvania is one of five states holding elections on April 26, and recent polling suggests that Mr. Trump, who is leading the Republican field in delegates, will perform well in all of them.
