 It wasn’t a Trump-branded hotel, but Donald J. Trump found the Holiday Inn Express in Sioux Center, Iowa, to be a perfectly suitable stand-in for Trump Tower or Mar-a-Lago.  Mr. Trump, who has rarely spent the night in one of the early states during the campaign, stayed at the relatively new hotel in western Iowa on Friday night, the first of a two-night stay in Iowa as he makes a heavy push for votes in the Feb. 1 caucuses.  “Good mattress, staff was great, good mattress, good everything,” Mr. Trump said Saturday. “It’s different and it’s certainly not Mar-a-Lago,” Mr. Trump said. But “it’s very nice.”  He added: “I actually enjoyed it. It was good, it was clean.”  The Holiday Inn Express overlooks the fifth hole of the Ridge Golf Course, the hotel says on its website, and it offers a 36-hole package deal that includes two rounds on the course for $209.99 a night.  His stay at the Holiday Inn Express was followed by an evening at the Royal Amsterdam Hotel in Pella, a Dutch village east of Des Moines. The hotel boasts of offering the “true European experience” on its website. Mr. Trump dined in the hotel restaurant, ordering steak and potatoes, his campaign said.
