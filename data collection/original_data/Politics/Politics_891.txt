 Still licking his wounds from losing the Iowa caucuses, Donald J. Trump is rolling out a new advertisement that ditches his gloom and doom about the dire state of America in favor of a more positive message.  Titled “Voter Voices,” Mr. Trump’s first new ad since the caucuses features a diverse set of supporters embracing his plan to “Make America Great Again.” Mr. Trump’s hard-line plans on immigration and the surveillance of American Muslims have led some to suggest that his appeal could be limited to white voters. And his controversial comments about women have raised questions about his ability to count on them voting for him in large numbers, especially in the New Hampshire primary on Tuesday.  However, the ad features women, African-Americans, Asians and Hispanics singing Mr. Trump’s praises.  “I came to hear Mr. Trump’s business plan for America,” one man says.  Mr. Trump often bemoans how far the United States has fallen, but in this case he is more upbeat.  “We have a country that we are proud of and that we love that we are not going to lose,” Mr. Trump says.  The ad also addresses a pet peeve of Mr. Trump’s — that the news media ignores the large crowds at his rallies. The footage is full of sweeping shots with vast audiences of adoring fans.
