 Former Senator Bob Dole of Kansas endorsed Jeb Bush for president on Wednesday, saying he believed that the former Florida governor was the best qualified candidate — and also making clear  that he still held a grudge against Senator Ted Cruz of Texas.  The endorsement, timed for Veterans Day — Mr. Dole fought in World War II — was announced by Mr. Bush’s campaign. But NBC News, in a brief interview with Mr. Dole, the Republican nominee for president in 1996, had cool words for only one candidate.  “I think he’s the most qualified, and we need somebody with experience and there are a lot of good candidates — I like nearly all of them,” Mr. Dole said of Mr. Bush and the rest of the field, before  quietly adding, “Except Cruz.”  Last year, at the Conservative Political Action Committee conference, Mr. Cruz offended Mr. Dole and his allies by mocking him, along with Senator John McCain and Mitt Romney, two other Republican presidential nominees considered members of the party’s establishment. “Those are good men, those are decent men — but when you don’t stand and draw a clear distinction, when you don’t stand for principle, Democrats celebrate,” Mr. Cruz said at the time.
