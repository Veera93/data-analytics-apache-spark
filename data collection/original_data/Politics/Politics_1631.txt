 Hillary Rodham Clinton hired her own version of “Mad Men” to enhance her stable of political advertising makers for her campaign, a young New York-based firm that created her most recent spots featuring four working women that highlighted pay equity and college affordability, according to two people privy to the work.  Droga5 was the firm that created Mrs. Clinton’s four recent spots, all targeting women, the two people said. The spots were praised by Republicans who called them a creative way to reach out to female voters, who make up a majority of the electorate and whose support will be crucial for Mrs. Clinton.  An aide to Mrs. Clinton confirmed that the group had been hired by the campaign, but refused to say whether it had worked on the four recent ads, which were different in tone and feel than the other spots the candidate has run so far. The campaign in general has declined to say who has made which spots, and the aide insisted that Mrs. Clinton’s ad makers — Mandy Grunwald, Jim Margolis and the Dixon/Davis Media Group — all work together on all ads that come from the campaign.  Still, the hiring of Droga5, which is based on Wall Street in Lower Manhattan, is reminiscent of Mrs. Clinton’s 2008 campaign, when she turned to the Madison Avenue ad-maker Jimmy Siegel to create some of her spots. Mr. Siegel now works for a Democratic rival of Mrs. Clinton’s, former Gov. Martin O’Malley of Maryland.   Officials with Droga5 worked on a project with the Clinton Foundation, which removed women’s faces from pictures and replaced them with the words “www.not-there.org.” Officials with Droga5 also designed a viral video for President Obama re-election campaign in 2012 featuring the comedian Sarah Silverman.
