 Five things we learned at this week’s Republican congressional retreat in Baltimore that might inform the 2016 agenda:  1. Despite some Republicans outside Congress broadcasting their antipathy for Donald Trump, congressional Republicans continue to make an uneasy public peace with him. The House speaker, Paul D. Ryan, pledged to support any Republican at the top of ticket, saying that any of them would be better than what the Democrats have to offer. Representative Steve Scalise of Louisiana, the No. 3 House Republican, said whoever wins the primary “is going to unite our party.”  2. Party members wanted to keep the focus of their news briefings on appropriations; reporters were interested in talking Trump. The two issues merged after Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, the Democratic leader, said in a statement that Senate Democrats would seek to force votes on Mr. Trump’s policies, “including his unconstitutional plan to bar people from entering the United States based on their religion.” Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader, basically said to bring it on, warning that Republicans would do the same vis-à-vis Democratic presidential candidates. “What’s good for the goose is good for the gander,” he said.  3. There is still much love for Mr. Ryan as members raved about his policy presentation. He seems to have retained his popularity and authority despite some attention-seeking members insisting to the conservative news media that “the honeymoon is over.” 4. A national security breakout session with Gen. Ray Odierno and others was sobering for many members. As such, defense hawks appear to be gaining ground on the budget hawks in discussions over national security and spending. 5. Republican members of Congress on an informal retreat prefer khakis, preferably paired with a V-neck. Mr. McConnell stuck to his jeans.
