 Senator Marco Rubio says he wants to slow down and amend the $1.1 trillion spending bill that is making its way through Congress. The problem? He had the chance to on Thursday but didn’t because he was campaigning for president in Iowa. On Thursday morning, Mr. Rubio voiced his distaste for the measure in an interview with Fox News, saying, “We can most certainly slow this process down and force them to go back and make changes to it.” And he went on: “There’s no doubt that we can and we should and we will. I think there’s an effort underway now among many conservatives in the Senate and in the House to make that happen.” The interview took place from southeastern Iowa. What Mr. Rubio apparently did not know when he spoke was that his fellow Republicans in the Senate had already unanimously agreed to schedule votes on the bill for Friday.  He could have exercised his right to object, which would have forced the Senate to take more time before voting.  Adam Jentleson, a senior aide for Senator Harry Reid, the Democratic leader, noted that it would have been relatively simple for Mr. Rubio to object. “Literally all you need to do is pick up the phone or send an email or have your staff do it,” Mr. Jentleson said.
