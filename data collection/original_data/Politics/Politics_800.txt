 COLUMBIA, S.C. — After winning over one of Gov. Chris Christie’s leading supporters, Gov. John Kasich of Ohio offered kind words for Mr. Christie on Friday, but said he had not asked him for an endorsement. Mr. Kasich, speaking to reporters here after addressing the South Carolina Chamber of Commerce, said he had had a “long, long conversation” with Mr. Christie, who exited the race on Wednesday after finishing sixth in the New Hampshire primary.  Mr. Kasich, 63, called Mr. Christie, 53, “a buddy of mine” and “a great guy.” He said that when the two men spoke on Thursday, he told Mr. Christie that the “sun’s going to come up, you’re a young man, and there’s great things in your future.” “But I’m not going to then go, ‘O.K., can I have your help?’” he said. “I mean, that’s not apropos.” Mr. Kasich’s campaign said on Thursday that Kenneth G. Langone, the billionaire co-founder of Home Depot who was a prominent backer of Mr. Christie, had thrown his support behind Mr. Kasich’s campaign. Mr. Christie’s final days in the race will be remembered for his verbal demolition of Senator Marco Rubio of Florida in the debate last Saturday. He had argued that an executive like himself — or, by extension, like Mr. Kasich — was much better suited to be president than a senator. The day after the debate, when asked about Mr. Kasich while campaigning in New Hampshire, Mr. Christie deemed himself better prepared to be president. Among other things, Mr. Christie cited the scrutiny he had received from the New York-area news media, saying, “The interrogation by The Akron Sun ain’t doing it.” But Mr. Christie still offered praise for Mr. Kasich, saying that “Ohio is much better off today because John Kasich has been governor for the last five years.” “If you told me you were going to vote for Kasich, I’d be disappointed, but I wouldn’t tell you, ‘Wow, that is an enormous mistake,’ ” Mr. Christie said. “Some others I would say that.”
