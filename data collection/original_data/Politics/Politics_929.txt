 DES MOINES – A Bloomberg-sponsored poll, made public in extravagant Bloomberg style amid shrimp and champagne, delivered some sour news about Michael R. Bloomberg himself: Few Iowa voters like him as he weighs a third party White House run. A poll of likely caucusgoers conducted for Bloomberg Politics and The Des Moines Register and released on Saturday night found just 17 percent of Democrats and 9 percent of Republicans had a “favorable” view of Mr. Bloomberg, the former mayor of New York. Among likely Republican caucus-goers in Iowa, half had an unfavorable view of Mr. Bloomberg; 26 percent of the Democrats had an unfavorable view of him. By comparison, 50 percent of the Republicans polled had a favorable view of another Manhattan billionaire, Donald J. Trump, whose candidacy has offended and baffled Mr. Bloomberg. And 46 percent of the Democrats had a favorable view of Martin O’Malley, who is faring poorly in polls, nearly three times the proportion viewing Mr. Bloomberg favorably. The poll was conducted by Selzer &amp; Co., and had a margin of error of plus or minus 4 percentage points. The polling related to Mr. Bloomberg — which to its credit made a point of asking about Mr. Bloomberg, the owner of Bloomberg News — was contained in a news release handed out to reporters. But the pollster on hand and the staff from Bloomberg Politics did not seem eager to highlight it. The data was discussed at the prodding of Ben Smith, editor in chief of BuzzFeed, who asked about it during an event for the news media held inside a TV studio custom-built for Bloomberg Politics here inside the Marriott hotel. One memorable flourish: a miniature aquarium, modeled after the much larger one in Bloomberg’s New York City headquarters. — Annie Linskey (@AnnieLinskey) January 31, 2016
