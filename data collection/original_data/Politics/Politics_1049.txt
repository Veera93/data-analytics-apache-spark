 As the Democratic presidential primary race has taken a harsher turn in the last few days, Hillary Clinton will try to focus on the group of supporters she hopes will lift her candidacy — women — as she campaigns in New Hampshire. Mrs. Clinton will appear at a dinner in Manchester hosted by Naral Pro-Choice New Hampshire, to celebrate the anniversary of the Supreme Court’s 1973 Roe v. Wade decision legalizing abortion. The dinner will also feature the state’s Democratic senator, Jeanne Shaheen. (Mrs. Clinton is not the only candidate who will be focusing on the anniversary. Carly Fiorina, the only woman running on the Republican side and a candidate who has been deeply critical of Planned Parenthood, is scheduled to appear at a March for Life event in Washington, weather permitting.) But for Mrs. Clinton, the rally is a chance to focus on her base of voters as polls show her losing ground to Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont. Mrs. Clinton has made protecting abortion rights a key component of her campaign and she has received the backing of the Naral Pro-Choice America PAC.  Mr. Sanders has seized on the endorsements from Naral and from Planned Parenthood’s political arm as evidence that Mrs. Clinton is part of the so-called establishment who is backed by special interest groups. Her campaign has fought that label, with allies pointing out that protecting abortion rights is also a central part of the Democratic Party’s agenda. It has been a rough week for Mrs. Clinton. But rather than seek distance from the “establishment” mantle, Mrs. Clinton has tightly embraced it. Whether that will work in an election cycle characterized by so much voter anger remains to be seen.
