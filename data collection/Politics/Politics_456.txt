 The “super PAC” formed to stop Donald J. Trump’s push for the Republican presidential nomination is spending $250,000 on television ads in Utah featuring Mitt Romney condemning the front-running candidate.  The ads from Our Principles PAC will begin running this weekend in the state, where voters will hold caucuses on Tuesday. Mr. Trump’s allies believe the Utah is likely to favor Senator Ted Cruz, who has a stronger organization and has performed better in such caucus states.  The state has a substantial Mormon population, and the group hopes that Mr. Romney’s appeal to Mormons will be decisive in achieving a Trump loss there.  The ad uses clips of Mr. Romney’s recent speech in Salt Lake City denouncing Mr. Trump. It is aimed less at influencing large groups of voters, and more at reaching out to people who respect Mr. Romney, including G.O.P. leaders in Washington.  “As we have said all along, Our Principles PAC will continue to educate the voters about who Donald Trump really is,” said Brian Baker,  the senior strategist for the PAC.  Despite Mr. Trump’s overwhelming delegate lead, strategists with the Our Principles PAC have argued that he will likely have a tough time accruing the 1,237 delegates needed to clinch the nomination.
