 The Democratic presidential primary has had its fill of policy proposals, but one liberal-leaning magazine is hoping to inject something else into the race: new ideas. The coming issue of Democracy, a policy journal, features what it calls “16 for ’16,” a package of ideas from scholars and activists to address issues like mass incarceration and college tuition transparency. The idea, said Andrei Cherny, one of the publication’s founding editors, is for Hillary Clinton and other Democrats running after eight years of a Democratic administration “to try to be ‘change’ and not ‘more of the same.’”  The proposals include an idea from Alan Khazei, a one-time Senate candidate in Massachusetts, to create a new, broader version of the G.I. Bill, in which the government would put $5,000 into an account for every new baby and allow the parents to make tax-free contributions to the fund similar to college-savings funds. But the account could not be accessed until the individual contributed 10 months of national service between the ages of 18 and 28. Another idea comes from Anne Kim, a scholar at the Progressive Policy Institute, who argues for requiring all states with more than two congressional districts to create a statewide House seat to replace one of their district seats.  Doing so, Ms. Kim writes, “would increase the number of competitive seats while bolstering the odds for moderate candidates.”
