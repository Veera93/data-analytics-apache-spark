He responded forcefully over the weekend, bringing up a controversy that emerged in her Senate campaign when it emerged that she had claimed minority status at Harvard because of her Native-American heritage. “She’s got about as much Indian blood as I have,” Mr. Trump said of Ms. Warren. “Her whole life was based on a fraud. She got into Harvard and all that because she said she was a minority.” At a news conference in Washington on Monday, Mr. Trump was asked about Ms. Warren’s criticism. “You mean the Indian?” he said before lamenting how divided the country had become. “People like Elizabeth Warren really have to get their act together.”
