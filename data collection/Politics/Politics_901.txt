 Donald J. Trump acknowledged on Tuesday night that his voter turnout operation in Iowa was weak, despite boasts from his team for weeks of a secret plan to get his supporters to the polls. “We didn’t have much of a ground game because I didn’t think I was going to be winning,” Mr. Trump said in an interview with Sean Hannity on Fox News. “That’s why I’m so honored to have come in second. Most people said I wouldn’t be in the top 10 originally when I started in Iowa.” He added, “And yeah, in retrospect, we could have done much better with the ground game, yes.” Mr. Trump had about a dozen staff members in Iowa, but his campaign’s efforts there were always shrouded in mystery. Mr. Trump came in second place in the caucuses, an outcome he had long said wouldn’t be acceptable. Senator Ted Cruz of Texas was the Republican winner, with nearly 28 percent of the vote, followed by Mr. Trump at 24 percent and Senator Marco Rubio of Florida at 23 percent. But Mr. Trump outperformed the 2012 Iowa caucuses winner, Rick Santorum, by 15,000 votes amid a record Republican turnout, indicating that, potentially, he could have claimed victory with a stronger voter targeting organization. Mr. Trump has no pollster, describing it as a waste of money when the media polls so frequently and those results are readily available.
