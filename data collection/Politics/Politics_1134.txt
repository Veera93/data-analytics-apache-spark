 Donald J. Trump versus Ted Cruz. Marco Rubio versus Mr. Cruz. Mr. Rubio versus Chris Christie. Jeb Bush versus almost everyone. The list of fight combinations that could take place at the Republican presidential debate on Thursday night, hosted in South Carolina by the Fox Business Network, is long.  With just seven candidates on the stage, the smallest number to take part in a prime-time Republican debate, each of them will most likely get more speaking time than they had in previous forums. That could be great for some, such as Mr. Christie, governor of New Jersey, or Gov. John R. Kasich of Ohio, both of whom are battling mightily to finish strong in New Hampshire, if not, win it outright.  It could be more daunting for others, such as Mr. Trump, who has not seemed to mind the long periods of quiet in past debates while other candidates slugged it out.  Mr. Bush, in the meantime, must find a way to combat the threats that Mr. Rubio, Mr. Christie and Mr. Kasich present.  Mr. Rubio, the Florida senator, and Mr. Cruz, the Texas senator, are finding themselves squeezed in a race that was supposed to be more clearly defined. Mr. Rubio is facing pressure from several candidates, including Mr. Cruz. But Mr. Cruz is also being chased from the right by Mr. Trump.  What is more, Mr. Cruz is certain to faces questions, possibly from many candidates as well as the moderators, about the $1 million in loans he received from Goldman Sachs to finance his Senate campaign in 2012, but which he did not disclose in federal filings as required.
