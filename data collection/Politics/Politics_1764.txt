 As Republican and Democratic presidential candidates continue to canvass Iowa, New Hampshire and other early nominating states, there is one state they would be wise not to overlook: Ohio. The Akron Buckeye Poll, released on Tuesday, shows that Ohio remains very much the battleground state it has been in recent presidential elections, and that Republicans have a strong chance of flipping the state to their side, after President Obama won it in 2008 and 2012. According to the survey of registered voters, 40 percent of Ohioans want a Democrat to continue controlling the White House, while 46 percent think it is time for a Republican to take over.  While that could unnerve Democrats, there were some good signs in the poll for the party, with the survey citing the stronger economy and improved optimism about economic prospects since the financial crisis of 2008. One thing that could help Republicans in the state is that they are holding their nominating convention in Cleveland next summer. David Gilbert, president of the Cleveland 2016 Host Committee, said on Tuesday that $41 million of the $58 million needed for the convention had already been raised. On the Democratic side, Ohioans surveyed overwhelmingly backed Hillary Rodham Clinton over Senator Bernie Sanders, 49 percent to 36 percent. Donald J. Trump remains the top Republican, with the support of 38 percent of the party’s voters. Ben Carson sits in second place at 20 percent, and Gov. John Kasich of Ohio is third at 17 percent.  John C. Green, director of the Ray C. Bliss Institute of Applied Politics, which conducted the poll, said that despite Mr. Kasich’s showing, he remains highly popular in the state and would likely provide a Republican ticket with a home-state advantage.
