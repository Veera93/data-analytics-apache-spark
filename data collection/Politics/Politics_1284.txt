 Senator Ted Cruz of Texas has raised nearly $20 million in the fourth quarter, his campaign said on Wednesday, an impressive haul that coincides with his rise in state and national polls in recent months. In a memo to staff members, Mr. Cruz’s campaign manager, Jeff Roe, said the campaign had raised over $45 million for the year. Mr. Cruz, who has cast himself as a rare conservative who can fuse grass-roots enthusiasm with a well-funded campaign, had already ended the third quarter with the most cash on hand of any Republican presidential candidate. (He raised $12.2 million last quarter.) “There’s still plenty of work to be done to make Ted the Republican nominee and the next president, but as 2015 comes to a close, we are exactly where we want to be,” Mr. Roe wrote in the memo. “Go. Fight. Win. This is OUR time!” He added that the campaign had received more than 670,000 donations from over 300,000 donors, with an average donation of about $67. Word of Mr. Cruz’s fund-raising, which was first reported by The Wall Street Journal, came hours after Jeb Bush’s campaign announced that it would reposition staff members from its Miami headquarters and place them in the early voting states. The Bush campaign said it was pulling planned television ad buys to focus more on ground operations. Over the last several weeks, Mr. Cruz has vaulted to the top of most Iowa polls and risen steadily in national surveys, where he and the rest of the field still trail Donald J. Trump.
