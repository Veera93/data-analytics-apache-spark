 Some facts about Representative Frederick H. Gillett: A Massachusetts Republican, he served as speaker of the House for six years in the early 1920s. He proposed an anti-polygamy amendment to the Constitution. He served in the Senate after the House, then apparently engaged in “literary pursuits.”  And his portrait was hastily chosen to replace that of former Speaker J. Dennis Hastert, whose visage was removed from the august speaker’s lobby outside the House floor over the weekend, on orders from Speaker Paul D. Ryan.  Mr. Hastert, the Illinois Republican who left office in 2007, recently pleaded guilty to violating banking laws and he acknowledged paying off someone to cover past misdeeds. A spokesman for Mr. Ryan said that the new speaker felt it was “appropriate” to rotate out that particular portrait, which seems to have disappeared off the face of the earth, as one of Mr. Ryan’s first acts since replacing John A. Boehner.  The walls of the speaker’s lobby feature portraits of over 20 former speakers, and the halls around the Capitol have several more. The tradition of hanging portraits began with the donation of a portrait of Henry Clay, who served as House speaker three times, from the artist Giuseppe Fagnani in 1852. In 1910, the House began to mandate oil paintings of the speakers.
