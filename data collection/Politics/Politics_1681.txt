 For months, Senator Marco Rubio has operated with a lean staff. But he is making a major addition to his communications team, with a veteran and respected Republican operative who was involved with his 2010 run for the Senate from Florida. Joe Pounder, one of the founders of the Republican opposition research firm America Rising, will join the Rubio team this month. The move had been in the works since the summer and planned for this fall. Mr. Pounder is known as an indefatigable researcher. But he is also deeply familiar with Mr. Rubio and his record, having worked on the 2010 race. In that campaign, Mr. Rubio faced some of the same questions about his finances that have been raised in the presidential race. Despite losing one of its key people to the Rubio campaign, America Risingâ€™s chairman, Matt Rhoades, said it remained neutral in the presidential primary contest. But Mr. Rhoades praised Mr. Pounder for his tireless work. The Rubio presidential campaign now has more than 70 full-time staff members, an increase of about 30 percent since Oct. 1, the campaign said.
