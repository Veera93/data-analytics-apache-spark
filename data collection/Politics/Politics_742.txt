 A new national poll from CBS News found that Donald J. Trump still holds a dominant lead atop the Republican field of presidential candidates, suggesting that he remains in a strong position ahead of the coming wave of primary elections. The survey found that 35 percent of Republican primary voters would like to see Mr. Trump win the party’s nomination. Senator Ted Cruz trails him with 18 percent, followed by Senator Marco Rubio with 12 percent and Gov. John Kasich of Ohio with 11 percent. Lagging the pack are Ben Carson with 6 percent and former Gov. Jeb Bush of Florida with 4 percent. The results will likely bring a sigh of relief to the Trump campaign after an NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll on Wednesday that showed Mr. Cruz erasing Mr. Trump’s lead nationally. However, separate polls from Quinnipiac University and from USA Today/Suffolk University showed the billionaire holding a substantial advantage. The CBS poll found that a majority of Republican voters think Mr. Trump has the best chance of winning in a general election and he is seen as the most likely candidate to get things done in Washington. Mr. Trump is seen as qualified as Mr. Cruz when it comes to appointing justices to the Supreme Court. Sniping between Mr. Cruz and Mr. Trump has intensified ahead of the South Carolina Republican primary on Saturday. Mr. Trump has threatened to sue the Texas senator for running false advertisements, while Mr. Cruz has said that Mr. Trump is not a true conservative because of his past liberal positions. According to the CBS survey, 50 percent of Republicans think that Mr. Trump shares their values and 35 percent would enthusiastically support his nomination. The poll had a margin of error of plus or minus five percentage points.
