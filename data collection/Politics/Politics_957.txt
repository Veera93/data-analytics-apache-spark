 The battle for second place in New Hampshire’s Republican primary has intensified, with Gov. John Kasich of Ohio, Senator Ted Cruz of Texas and former Gov. Jeb Bush of Florida all pulling about 11 or 12 percent of the vote, and Senator Marco Rubio of Florida about 10 percent, according to a poll released Thursday. Still way out ahead is Donald J. Trump, the business mogul and reality TV star, with 26 percent of the vote, according to the poll of the state’s likely Republican primary voters conducted by Suffolk University. The ups and downs of the political donnybrook appear only to have solidified Mr. Trump’s lead, as he commands the field of 30 official challengers, a dozen of whom are perceived as serious. Following the top five candidates in the poll were Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey at 6 percent; Ben Carson at 5 percent, Carly Fiorina at 4 percent and Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky at 2 percent. A Suffolk poll last week of Democratic primary voters in New Hampshire found Senator Bernie Sanders leading Hillary Clinton, the former secretary of state, 50 percent to 41 percent, with former Gov. Martin O’Malley of Maryland at 2 percent and 6 percent still undecided. New Hampshire holds the country’s first primaries on Feb. 9, eight days after Iowa’s caucuses. The new poll questioned 500 Republican voters likely to vote in the primary from Monday through Wednesday and had a margin of sampling error of plus or minus four percentage points.
