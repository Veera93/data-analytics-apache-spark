 Hillary Rodham Clinton and former President Bill Clinton next month will hold their first event for the Hillary Victory Fund, an arrangement that allows donors to give tens of thousands of dollars to the national and state Democratic Parties.  The event will be held on Dec. 17 and will feature a performance by the musician Sting in New York City, according to an invitation that was sent out on Friday.  It is the only event that Mrs. Clinton will hold for the Victory Fund this year. Tickets per guest are $33,400, and attendees can write an additional $10,000 check to each of the various state parties with which the Clinton campaign has entered joint fund-raising agreements.  Mrs. Clinton’s campaign has been looking for ways to engage higher-spending donors for months, as her rival, Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, has capitalized on a populist wave and a strong Internet following to raise more than $26 million in small donations.  The Hillary Victory Fund money will be spread throughout the campaign, which gets the maximum for the nominating contest of $2,700 per donor. But such an event will also help replenish money for the Democratic National Committee, which was regarded mostly as a backwater during Barack Obama’s presidency and which has seen much of its organizational muscle spread into groups like Organizing for Action, an organization that represents the remnants of the Obama campaign.  “Strengthening the Democratic Party is a top priority for Hillary Clinton, so she’s doing her best to ensure the D.N.C. and state parties across the country have the resources they need to help the Democratic nominee win next November,” said Josh Schwerin, a spokesman for Mrs. Clinton.
