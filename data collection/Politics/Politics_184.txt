 It was the most unexpected cameo of the White House Correspondents’ Association dinner on Saturday: There, in the video with President Obama, was none other than John A. Boehner, the former House speaker.  On Monday, White House officials said that Mr. Boehner was a good sport when they called to see if he would join in the comedic tradition of producing a presidential video for the gala dinner. “As was evident from the finished product, he was an enthusiastic participant in the production,” Josh Earnest, the White House press secretary, told reporters. Filming took place on Friday, just a day before the dinner, and gave the president and his one-time legislative adversary plenty of time to hang out. Mr. Earnest said there was no separate, formal meeting, but he did not deny that they might have talked about current events. The two men spent time together just a day after Mr. Boehner’s comments about Senator Ted Cruz of Texas — “Lucifer in the flesh” — were reported. Mr. Earnest said, “There was not a detailed discussion of those comments, no.” But it’s clear they had a good time just from watching the video, especially the part where Mr. Boehner offers Mr. Obama a cigarette and the president’s eyes widen longingly. “Look, Speaker Boehner has a well-known and very good sense of humor,” Mr. Earnest said. “He made, I think, a very positive contribution to our comedic efforts in the film.” In a post on Twitter on Monday, Mr. Boehner said he had a good time filming the video with the president and noted that the “cigarette gag was president’s idea! Nice job by @WhiteHouse media team.”
