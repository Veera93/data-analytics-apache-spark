 LAS VEGAS – “I am Hispanic, and I vote for Mr. Trump!” the woman exclaimed. Donald J. Trump, at a rally inside a Cirque du Soleil theater here, had invited the woman up on stage after she flashed a copy of the recent issue of People magazine with Mr. Trump on the cover. Given that Mr. Trump has disparaged nearly all of Mexico — saying their leaders are swindlers who have plotted to send their worst criminals to the United States — showing that he has some Hispanic support is a matter of pride, if not a way of proving that he is not the racist critics say he is. The woman, who shrieked and jumped up and down as Mr. Trump’s security guards helped her on stage, said she was from Colombia. Mr. Trump laughed and swore he hadn’t planted her in the audience. Then he completed a little riff about how the editors at People had manipulated the photo to give him a wart on his nose that doesn’t exist, signed her magazine and kissed her on the cheek.
