 Rollicking. Bumpy. A little cramped. The presidential race has at last entered a phase befitting an unruly election season: It is time for the buses. Though the common bus tour can seem quaint in the age of “super PACs” and the Twitter supremacy of Donald J. Trump, it remains an unpretentious equalizer across states that have long insisted on greeting their candidates personally.

 This week, Ted Cruz is attempting an ambitious heave — a six-day, 28-town swing that the campaign has labeled “Cruzin’ to Caucus” — as he seeks to cement his status as the front-runner in Iowa. What follows is an accounting of the places, faces and culinary selections of 2016’s first proper bus tour.

They both smiled.
