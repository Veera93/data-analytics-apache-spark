 MANCHESTER, Iowa — Senator Ted Cruz of Texas suggested a simple explanation on Monday for his sudden antagonism toward Donald J. Trump in recent weeks: The other guy started it. “My approach to Donald Trump is the same as it was before, in that I will not engage in insults. I will not engage in personal attacks,” Mr. Cruz told reporters before an event at a restaurant here. “Donald has changed how he has approached me. He is now insulting me every day. He can do that. That’s his prerogative.” Mr. Cruz has a case: It was Mr. Trump who escalated hostilities by persistently raising questions about Mr. Cruz’s Canadian birth, suggesting Mr. Cruz might not be eligible for the presidency. Mr. Trump has also disparaged Mr. Cruz’s personality, casting himself as a bridge-builder and a pragmatist. Mr. Cruz, who for months praised Mr. Trump and cheered his presence in the race, has framed things another way. In his telling, establishment figures have flocked from Senator Marco Rubio of Florida to Mr. Trump because they view Mr. Trump as a candidate they can work with.  At the news conference, Mr. Cruz coyly advised against nominating “a dealmaker who will surrender yet more on our principles,” raising Mr. Trump’s history of left-leaning positions on issues like abortion rights. “Issues are something different,” Mr. Cruz said of his own attacks on Mr. Trump. “That is and should be the meat of politics.” “There is a season to those discussions,” he added, “We are in the season where we are discussing the differences in policy.”
