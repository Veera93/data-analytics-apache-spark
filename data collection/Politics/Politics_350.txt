 Senator Bernie Sanders is holding out hope that a strong showing at the Clark County convention in Nevada over the weekend could help him top Hillary Clinton in the race for the state’s delegates. Mrs. Clinton beat Mr. Sanders in the Democratic caucuses in Nevada in February, garnering an estimated 20 delegates to his 15. But the hunt for delegates does not end there. On Saturday Mr. Sanders’s campaign managed to mobilize more delegates to the convention in Nevada’s largest county, likely narrowing his delegate deficit and potentially overtaking her. Jeff Weaver, Mr. Sanders’s campaign manager, said that the campaign had narrowed the gap by at least four net delegates and potentially won as many as eight delegates. The Sanders campaign said that it drew nearly 3,000 delegates to the convention while the Clinton campaign had about 2,300. Other counties in Nevada are also holding such conventions ahead of the state convention in May. “It was a pretty big day for us,” Mr. Weaver said in an interview. “It’s testament to the level of organization we have on the ground and frankly the lack of enthusiasm on the other side.” Brian Fallon, a spokesman for Mrs. Clinton, attributed the tepid turnout to widespread confusion among her supporters about when they needed to show up. — Brian Fallon (@brianefallon) April 3, 2016
