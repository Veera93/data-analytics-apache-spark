 There are two significant presidential debates over the next seven days as the races hurtle toward the first casting of votes. Each debate will take place in Charleston, S.C. On the Republican side on Thursday, the debate is sponsored by Fox Business Network, which hosted a forum in November that was heavily focused on policy. This one could be, as well, but the candidates have every incentive to attack one another onstage aggressively. Will Donald J. Trump, who has criticized his rivals before past debates only to lay down his arms once there, go after Senator Ted Cruz of Texas in the same way that he has in rallies and on television news programs? Will Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey, who has mocked Senator Marco Rubio of Florida as weak, go for the jugular? And will Mr. Rubio be so prepared for these kinds of attacks from his rivals that they fall short? Can any of the other candidates gain traction? As a warm-up for the Democratic debate on Sunday, a Black and Brown Forum in Iowa on Monday will focus heavily on issues involving minorities who have been killed by the police. Hillary Clinton has been hammering Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont over his record on gun control. So has Martin Oâ€™Malley, though he has criticized Mrs. Clinton as well. The prime-time debate is the last occasion the Democrats will face off before the Iowa caucuses on Feb. 1.
