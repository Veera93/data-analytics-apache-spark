 Updated, 12:53 p.m. | PAWLEYS ISLAND, S.C. — A prep school gymnasium packed with 500 people hoping to see Marco Rubio on Friday was disappointed to learn that the Florida senator had to pull out of the morning campaign event at the last minute because of plane trouble.  At about 11:30 a.m., people came streaming out of the Lowcountry Preparatory School after a campaign volunteer announced the news. Some in the audience muttered sarcastically that the cause must have been sabotage by the campaign of Senator Ted Cruz, who has been engaged in an especially bitter and tense feud with Mr. Rubio in the final days before the South Carolina primary. The Rubio campaign was trying to juggle things on Friday and reschedule the Pawleys Island event for later at night, but no time was given. The senator has been climbing in many polls taken over the last few days. And he clearly did not want to risk a no-show that would jeopardize his apparently growing popularity going into South Carolina’s Republican primary on Saturday. “I was excited to see him,” said Teresa Nash, 47, of nearby Murrells Inlet. “But I voted for him already,” she added, saying she had filled out an absentee ballot. Mr. Rubio has been taking criticism from rivals like Mr. Cruz for canceling a campaign appearance on Thursday night. His campaign said that was because of scheduling issues.
