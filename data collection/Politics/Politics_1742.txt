 The Republican debate on CNBC on Wednesday night drew 14 million viewers, a record for the network but the lowest showing in the presidential debates this year. The previous two Republican debates, on Fox News in August and on CNN last month, each attracted more than 23 million viewers. That shattered records for presidential nominating debates, and were among the most viewed events in cable television history. Donald J. Trump has been widely credited with igniting interest in the debates this year, but even CNN’s Democratic debate in mid-October brought in 15.8 million viewers, another record. Executives at CNBC cautioned ahead of time that the number of viewers Wednesday would be lower than the past debates — the financial cable channel isn’t as predictable a home for a presidential debate as a cable news channel is, and this debate ran opposite Game 2 of the World Series. Still, CNBC asked advertisers for as much as $250,000 for 30-second commercial spots, significantly higher than what it normally asks for in prime time. This was CNBC’s highest-rated program ever by a considerable margin. The previous high was for Olympics coverage in 2002, which brought in 3.9 million. CNBC’s Republican debate in 2011 had an audience of 3.3 million people. CNBC has confronted withering criticism in the hours since the debate. Reince Priebus, the chairman of the Republican National Committee, said the network “should be ashamed of how this debate was handled,” and various candidates complained about the CNBC moderators’ performance, saying they were too aggressive and displayed a liberal bias.
