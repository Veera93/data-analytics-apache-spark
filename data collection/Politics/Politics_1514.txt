 Senator Marco Rubio of Florida will make a pair of campaign stops on Tuesday in Alabama and South Carolina, part of his attempt to make inroads in important Southern states that could play decisive roles in determining the Republican presidential nominee.  His visit could also be a prelude of sorts to a looming clash with Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, who is betting heavily on the South and who has made trip after trip there to help shore up his support. Mr. Rubio has been attacking Mr. Cruz repeatedly over the last week for his vote to end the National Security Agency’s bulk data collection programs. (Because of changes Congress made to the law, the programs expired over the weekend.) Mr. Rubio is showing no signs of letting up. After a campaign stop in New Hampshire on Monday, he told Fox News: “There are Republicans, including Senator Cruz, that have voted to weaken those programs. That is just part of the record, it is nothing personal.” Though it is starting to sound more and more that way given how often Mr. Rubio now invokes his colleague’s name.
