 The Federal Election Commission has a math problem. Its membership is split evenly between Democratic appointees and Republicans. So the six-member commission in charge of regulating and enforcing how campaigns can raise and spend money often reaches deadlocks, leading critics to label the group as partisan and ineffectual. Now it would appear the commission also has a grammar problem. After failing to agree on the issue this month, commissioners will consider on Thursday whether to tweak an existing regulation by changing the word “the” to the word “a.” The “the” in question appears in a regulation stating that outside groups must report money they spend supporting a candidate at regular points during “the calendar year.” The proposal, which was recommended by the commission’s lawyers for clarity, would change the wording to “a calendar year.” But during the April 14 commission meeting, Lee E. Goodman, a Republican commissioner, questioned whether the proposed change had clarified anything at all. He suggested kicking off a potentially lengthy rule-making process to discuss the matter further. Commissioner Ellen L. Weintraub, a Democrat, accused Mr. Goodman of “making a mountain out of a molehill” over a “completely straightforward technical change.” This back-and-forth is familiar to Lawrence M. Noble, general counsel at the Campaign Legal Center, who spent 13 years as general counsel for the Federal Election Commission. “They spend time clarifying rules that are already clear, as opposed to enforcing them,” he said. As the “a” versus “the” discussion progressed, it became clear to some commission members that compromise would not come easily. “I sense a deadlock,” said the commission’s vice chairman, Steven Walther, calling for a short break after debating the issue for 20 minutes. Soon after the commissioners returned, they had reached an agreement: They would table the issue until Thursday.
