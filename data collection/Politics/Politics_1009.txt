 Senator Bernie Sanders and Donald J. Trump appear to be the candidates to beat in New Hampshire, according to a poll released Monday that showed them with commanding leads two weeks before the state’s primary.   A Franklin Pierce University/Boston Herald survey found that 55 percent of likely Democratic primary voters support Mr. Sanders and 39 percent back Hillary Clinton. A month ago Mr. Sanders was leading by two percentage points. Those surveyed remain attracted to Mrs. Clinton’s experience, but say that Mr. Sanders resonates more on issues that they care about such as the economy and income inequality.  The race between the two leading Democratic candidates has become increasingly contentious in recent weeks, with arguments intensifying over Mrs. Clinton’s ties to Wall Street and the feasibility of Mr. Sanders’s progressive agenda. The Vermont senator is also leading in some Iowa polls, raising the prospect that Mrs. Clinton could lose the first two states that kick off the nomination process.  On the Republican side, Mr. Trump continues to dominate the field. The poll shows 33 percent of likely Republican primary voters backing the billionaire developer, with 14 percent supporting Senator Ted Cruz of Texas and 12 percent supporting a rising Gov. John Kasich of Ohio. Jeb Bush, Senator Marco Rubio of Florida and Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey make up the next tier in New Hampshire, with 9 percent, 8 percent and 7 percent, respectively. While there remains time to change minds in New Hampshire, three-fourths of Mr. Trump’s supporters said that they were firmly in his corner. Mr. Trump’s backers cite his new ideas and the prospect of him leading the country in a new direction as the main reasons that they are behind him.  The poll had a margin of error of plus or minus five percentage points.
