 Hillary Rodham Clinton raised about $28 million during the last three months, her campaign announced on Wednesday, a few million dollars ahead of her nearest rival for the Democratic nomination, Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, who announced earlier in the evening that he had raised $24 million. Update: His campaign later revised the number to about $26 million since July. The total, which aides said was within their projections, was a sharp falloff from Mrs. Clinton’s fund-raising in the first few months of the race, reflecting in part the traditional summer slowdown among donors and the growing possibility that another Democrat popular among the party’s major donors, Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., might enter the race. Mrs. Clinton also raised about $3 million for Democratic Party committees, taking advantage of new rules that made it easier for the biggest donors to spread checks around to a variety of candidates and party committees. The most striking contrast between Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Sanders is less the quantity of funds raised than who donated: Mr. Sanders has depended almost entirely on small donors, who have flocked to his campaign at a rate exceeding any other Democrat in recent memory, while Mrs. Clinton has been relying to a greater extent on traditional large donors giving the maximum $2,700 contribution. Neither campaign would release a precise tally on Wednesday night of the percentage of their funds coming from small donors. “Thanks to our supporters, we are able to meet our goals and build an organization that can mobilize millions of voters to ensure Hillary Clinton is their fighter in the White House,” Robby Mook, Mrs. Clinton’s campaign manager, said in a statement.
