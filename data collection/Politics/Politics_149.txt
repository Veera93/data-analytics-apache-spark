 Donald J. Trump announced Monday that Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey will lead his transition team, part of Mr. Trump’s effort to shift his focus to the general election campaign and to prepare for a potential White House victory. “Governor Christie is an extremely knowledgeable and loyal person with the tools and resources to put together an unparalleled transition team, one that will be prepared to take over the White House when we win in November,” Mr. Trump said in a press release. “I am grateful to Governor Christie for his contributions to this movement.” Mr. Christie, after ending his own presidential bid, quickly threw his support behind Mr. Trump, who has agreed to headline a fund-raiser for Mr. Christie, to help him pay off his remaining campaign debt — an early test,perhaps, of Mr. Trump’s fund-raising prowess. Previously, Mr. Trump gave his son-in-law, Jared Kushner, the task of helping create a blueprint for his transition team, though Mr. Kushner is not expected to have any official role on the team.  “I am honored by the confidence being placed in me by Mr. Trump and look forward to putting together a first-rate team to assemble an administration to help best serve the president-elect and the nation,” Mr. Christie said in a statement.  In a dig at Hillary Clinton, Mr. Trump’s probable rival in the November election, the Trump campaign said in a news release that Mr. Trump was  taking “critical steps” to prepare for a general election contest “against potential Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton, or whoever.”
