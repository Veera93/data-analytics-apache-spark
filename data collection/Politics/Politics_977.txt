 Donald J. Trump’s campaign manager used slightly less absolute words on Wednesday about Mr. Trump’s plans to skip Thursday night’s Republican presidential debate, saying he didn’t “think” there was any way the candidate would change his mind about attending the event on Fox News.  Corey Lewandowski, the campaign manager, spoke on MSNBC’s “Morning Joe” program. One of the hosts, Mika Brzezinski, pressed him on whether Mr. Trump might change his mind and join the debate in Iowa, the final one before the state’s caucuses on Monday.  “Any chance that he will do this debate in any way, shape or form?” she asked. “Any way to turn this around?” “I just don’t think so,” Mr. Lewandowski said. “What you have with Mr. Trump, that you have a clear leader. A person who he says at best is not going to be toyed with. A person who understands when a bad deal is in front of him and is ready to walk away from a bad deal. Something that this country should be able to do.” He added, referring to the debate’s possible ratings: “And I just don’t see in any way where Fox is going to have a successful debate now, when you got the clear G.O.P. front-runner who has decided to walk away from this debate because he can’t be treated fairly at the debate stage. Maybe Fox was going to have a 20- or 25-million person debate. But without Mr. Trump’s participation, I think they may have a one- or two-million person debate.”  A day earlier, Mr. Lewandowski said definitively that Mr. Trump would not be there.  Mr. Trump and the network engaged in a  high-stakes game of chicken, largely over a feud about Megyn Kelly moderating the debate. On Monday afternoon, the network released a statement mocking Mr. Trump in stark terms. That’s what the candidate said he was reacting to on Tuesday night.
