 NEW ORLEANS — An almost constant stream of protesters interrupted Donald J. Trump’s nighttime rally here Friday, often resisting removal and dropping to the ground as security personnel tried to hustle them from the event. Almost every Trump rally has attracted protesters, but on Friday night they practically overtook the event, and “Get ’em out of here” sometimes felt like Mr. Trump’s most repeated line. “This is a wild evening,” Mr. Trump said halfway through his rally on the eve of the Louisiana primary. “This is one hell of a way to spend a Friday evening.” The protests started early, as the sun dropped low in the sky and cast a purplish gloaming haze on the rally in an airport hangar, and continued as the night turned slate black. They included solitary individuals and coordinated groups. African-American protesters from the Black Lives Matter movement spoke up, as Trump supporters chanted them down with shouts of “All lives matter! All lives matter!” A lone man halted the proceedings when he lifted a homemade sign that said, on one side, “KKK 4 Trump,” and, on the other, “Trump Duke 2016” — a reference to the Ku Klux Klan’s onetime leader David Duke, who has praised Mr. Trump and whom Mr. Trump recently failed to disavow immediately in an interview. At times, the scene was confusing even to Mr. Trump, who tried to keep control from the stage. “Friend or foe?” he asked at one point, noticing yet another commotion. “Friends we don’t mind.” But, it seemed, the voter was yet another foe. “Stupid people,” Mr. Trump muttered, before returning to his speech.
