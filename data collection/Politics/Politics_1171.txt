 President Obama will make one of his final prime-time addresses to the country on Tuesday, and the White House is leaving no platform uncovered in its effort to magnify its message. The president’s staff announced the latest addition to its outreach arsenal on Monday, with the opening of an official White House Snapchat account. On Tuesday, it will carry behind the scenes images and video of the State of the Union preparation, “with footage and angles you won’t find anywhere else,” according to Joshua Miller, the director of product management at the White House.  Josh Earnest, the White House press secretary, said the Snapchat messages would be preserved for the National Archives as required. “We’ve been able to work this out with them,” he said. “I’m not exactly sure how, but we have.” The executive mansion will also open to a live broadcast on NBC’s “Today” on Tuesday, a first for traditional broadcast media, as well as a live YouTube question-and-answer to take place in the East Room on Friday. The YouTube Q. and A. has become something of a post-address tradition for Mr. Obama, who has participated in a conversation broadcast on YouTube each year since 2010. This year, the White House said it has tapped three of the platform’s stars, who boast a combined following of more than 12 million subscribers, to ask the questions. They include Destin Sandlin, an Alabama engineer who hosts the science-focused channel “Smarter Every Day”; Ingrid Nilsen, a California host who came out on YouTube last year; and Adande Thorne, a former professional gamer and video animator who hosts videos under the name sWooZie. The interviews will be broadcast live from the East Room of the White House on Friday at 2:15 p.m. In case the new media swirl is not enough, Mr. Obama will try out more traditional pavement-pounding promotion on Wednesday and Thursday, when he is scheduled to travel to to Omaha and Baton Rouge, La.
