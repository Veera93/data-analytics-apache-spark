 Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey is riding high after a coveted endorsement from The New Hampshire Union Leader, but he is not winning such accolades at home. The editorial board of The Star-Ledger of Newark, New Jersey’s most prominent newspaper, issued a sharp rebuttal to the endorsement of Mr. Christie, arguing that his appeal was based on showmanship rather than his performance as governor. “The paper knows almost nothing about his record as governor,” Tom Moran, the editorial page editor, wrote, referring to The Union Leader and calling Mr. Christie a “slick character” with a knack for making nice speeches but getting little done. The lane closings on the George Washington Bridge. Jobs. Pension reform. The Star-Ledger argues that Mr. Christie has been a failure on all fronts, including his handling of Hurricane Sandy, which the governor has called a seminal moment in his evolution as a leader. The Union Leader considered those to be nonissues or problems that were out of Mr. Christie’s control. An experienced conservative who can work across party lines is what America needs, it argued in its endorsement. Mr. Christie spent significant time away from New Jersey as he traveled the country raising money for the Republican Governors Association and more recently as he campaigned for president. His poll numbers in the state have fallen in recent months, and rivals such as Donald J. Trump have pointed out his lack of popularity among those who know him best. According to The Star-Ledger, the fact that Mr. Christie has been more focused on his own ambitions than on his state should give voters in New Hampshire and elsewhere pause as they consider him for the Republican nomination. “Christie is not even paying attention to New Jersey these days, despite the bad shape we’re in,” Mr. Moran wrote. “Legislators and business leaders can’t get their calls returned.”
