 The Boston Globe, New England’s largest newspaper, has “enthusiastically” endorsed Hillary Clinton for the Democratic presidential nomination. In an editorial posted on its website Sunday night under the headline “Hillary Clinton deserves Democratic nomination,” the newspaper writes that Mrs. Clinton is “someone who can keep what Obama got right, while also fixing his failures, especially on gun control and immigration reform.” Often glowing, but at times combative, the editorial criticizes Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, Mrs. Clinton’s chief rival, nearly as often as it praises her. The editorial focuses heavily on gun control at the outset, praising Mrs. Clinton’s “assertive record” on guns while harshly critiquing Mr. Sanders’s record, pointing to his vote against the Brady background check bill and calling him “not a convincing champion of gun control.” The editorial also criticizes Mr. Sanders’s plan for a single-payer health care system, writing that the candidate “isn’t leveling with voters about the cost and disruption the transition to such a system would entail,” a critique often leveled by the Clinton campaign. And while it praises Mr. Sanders’s emphasis on income inequality, the editorial also says he has been too singularly focused on the issue, “crowding out equally substantive matters of foreign and domestic policy.” The endorsement came just a day after Mrs. Clinton won the endorsement of the largest newspaper in Iowa, The Des Moines Register.
