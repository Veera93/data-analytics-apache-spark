 It looks as if it is a go for Representative Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin’s run for speaker. While he did not secure the formal endorsement of the hard-right Freedom Caucus on Wednesday night, Mr. Ryan appeared to get the backing of a supermajority of its members, enough for him to call it a positive step for a Republican unity — one of his chief conditions for running. He still has to receive the backing of a few other factions of House Republicans, but that seems very likely to come on Thursday, a day before Mr. Ryan’s self-imposed deadline for bringing together the party behind him. Perhaps the only remaining impediment for Mr. Ryan is time. The internal party election is not scheduled until next Wednesday, followed by a vote on the floor the next day. The delay could allow outside conservative groups time to build opposition to Mr. Ryan, but, for the moment, he seems in command.
