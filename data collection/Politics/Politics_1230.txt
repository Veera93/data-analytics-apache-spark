 Ted Cruz is on a six-day, 28-town swing through Iowa. These are the places, faces and culinary selections of 2016’s first proper bus tour. EVENT 12 Time: 5:46 p.m., Jan. 6 Place: Spencer, Iowa (population: 11,233) Site: Clay County Regional Events Center, in a ballroom with double-doors and carpeting dark enough to conceal any spills Mood: sprightly hotel convention Weapon of choice: Mr. Cruz has taken to praising Representative Steve King, a supporter who is traveling with him, as a “strong, principled constitutionalist knife-fighter.” Cruz analogy on social safety net: “It should be a trampoline and not a hammock.” Highlight: As he greeted supporters after his speech, Mr. Cruz encountered a 5-year-old with a gap in his teeth. “You lost it!” he said, as the boy, Oliver Jensen, smiled from his father’s shoulders. “You can drink from a straw with your mouth closed,” Mr. Cruz said. “That’s pretty cool.”
