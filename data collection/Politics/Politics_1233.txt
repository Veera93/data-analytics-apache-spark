EVENT 9 Time: 10:42 a.m., Jan. 6 Place: Rock Rapids, Iowa (population: 2,549) Site: Union Jacks, a British-themed restaurant festooned with images of Churchill, the Beatles and double-decker buses Mood: pastoral pub crawl Food: cheese nuggets, Bully burger, chicken salad croissant Advice on the wall: “Keep Calm and Fake a British Accent” Cruz assessments of the four audience questions: “Great question,” “very good question,” “thank you for that question,” “that’s a very good question.” Highlight: Mr. Cruz, reacting to North Korea’s claim that it tested a hydrogen bomb, offered his appraisal of Kim Jong-un: “crazy nutcase.” “That’s a technical term,” he added. He blamed North Korea’s prowess on the administration of Bill Clinton, introducing a new phrase on the stump: “Clinton-Obama-Clinton foreign policy.”
