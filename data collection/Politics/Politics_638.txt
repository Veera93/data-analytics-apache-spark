 Meg Whitman, the Hewlett-Packard executive who was a top supporter of Gov. Chris Christie’s presidential campaign, on Sunday criticized Mr. Christie for supporting Donald J. Trump, assailing him for “political opportunism” and calling on Mr. Trump’s other supporters and donors to walk away from him.  The comments from Ms. Whitman came in a statement to NBC News two days after Mr. Christie made his surprise endorsement of Mr. Trump, someone the governor had previously suggested was ill-prepared to become president. Mr. Christie, a former chairman of the Republican Governors Association, has since reached out to other elected officials, and called his donor network, to seek more establishment support for Mr. Trump.  “Chris Christie’s endorsement of Donald Trump is an astonishing display of political opportunism,” Ms. Whitman, who was a national finance co-chair of the Christie campaign, said in the statement. “Donald Trump is unfit to be president,” Ms. Whitman said. “He is a dishonest demagogue who plays to our worst fears. Trump would take America on a dangerous journey. Christie knows all that and indicated as much many times publicly. The governor is mistaken if he believes he can now count on my support, and I call on Christie’s donors and supporters to reject the governor and Donald Trump outright. I believe they will. For some of us, principle and country still matter.” Mr. Christie, the governor of New Jersey, dropped out of the presidential race after finishing in an embarrassing sixth place in the New Hampshire primary. He could not be reached for comment.
