 GULFPORT, Miss. — Gov. John Kasich of Ohio vowed Wednesday to remain in the Republican race, declaring himself the party’s only hope of defeating Donald J. Trump. “Of course I’m staying in,” he told reporters. “Why would I drop out when I’ve got the best chance to be the nominee outside of Trump?” Mr. Kasich warned that his departure from the race would have consequences. “If I get out, which I’m not going to do, Trump is absolutely going to be the nominee,” he said. “End of story.” At a town-hall-style event here, Mr. Kasich said that he would beat Mr. Trump in a two-man race. But it is not clear what would have to happen to leave Mr. Kasich alone in the field with Mr. Trump, who won the Nevada caucuses on Tuesday. Mr. Kasich, who did not compete there, finished fifth. The campaign of Senator Marco Rubio of Florida, who is vying for the same mainstream voters as Mr. Kasich, has argued that Mr. Kasich has no realistic way of winning the Republican nomination. The more conventional view is that by remaining in the race, Mr. Kasich is making it more difficult for Mr. Rubio to take on Mr. Trump.  But Mr. Kasich was adamant that he would not leave the race, saying that “everybody just needs to chill out.” “You know enough about football down here, that it’s really not what the score is at the first quarter, it’s what the score is at the end of the game,” he said.
