 BOW, N.H. — Some of Jeb Bush’s major donors have been worried about the negative tone that Right to Rise, the “super PAC” supporting Mr. Bush, has taken in criticizing his Republican rivals. They aren’t the only ones concerned. At a town-hall-style event here on Saturday, Ernst Kastning, 71, of Concord, N.H., stood to commend Mr. Bush for not attacking other candidates during his events. “I attack Trump,” Mr. Bush said, to laughter and applause. “He’s the one I really think you have a right to, as someone who’s unhinged and a jerk,” Mr. Kastning said, before turning back to his original query. Holding up a mailer from Right to Rise, he continued: “What I don’t like are the other ones that are coming in the mail, like two or three a day, which attack your other fellow candidates. You don’t do this in your town halls, to attack the other candidates very specifically.” Some of Mr. Bush’s donors have expressed dismay over the negative advertising produced by the super PAC, believing it could hurt the eventual Republican nominee if it is not Mr. Bush. Mr. Bush, who is prohibited by law from coordinating with his super PAC, politely dismissed the concern, citing what he said was the inherently rough nature of politics. “The level of attacking back and forth in this campaign is pretty timid and tame, compared to previous campaigns,” he said. “This is bean bag time. I mean, you think this is ugly, wait until Hillary Clinton and the Clinton machine gets going.” Later, speaking to Mr. Kastning after the event, Mr. Bush — who will criticize his opponents when asked, speaking favorably about his own record — added, “You’ve got to allow a little leeway for compare and contrast.”
