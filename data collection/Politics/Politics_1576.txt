 “Super PACs,” the outside groups that can raise unlimited funds but can’t coordinate with candidates they support, have unquestionably had an impact on the 2016 presidential race. But to what extent and in what ways is not yet clear. Two leading election lawyers – Bob Bauer, a Democrat, and Ben Ginsberg, a Republican – will lead a research project with major universities and veterans of presidential politics to answer that question, along with others about campaign finance, one of the premier issues of the 2016 presidential race. Their report, to be issued in 2017, will draw on deep analysis of spending data, including looking at how campaign financing affected the nominating contests in both parties. The idea is not to be prescriptive but instead diagnostic about the way the huge changes in the campaign finance system since 2010 have altered presidential politics. The study may be one of the only ways to quantify the full impact not just of an influx of unlimited donations, but of social media and digital advertising on the race. Advertising patterns in particular will be difficult to discern after a Republican contest that at one point had 17 candidates, many of them with super PACs supporting them. Political scientists from around the country have agreed to take part in the project, as have scholars from Harvard, Brigham Young University and the Universities of Massachusetts, Missouri and Wisconsin.
