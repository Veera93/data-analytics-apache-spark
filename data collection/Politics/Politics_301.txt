 Senator Charles E. Grassley of Iowa, a Republican and the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, will host Judge Merrick B. Garland, President Obama’s Supreme Court nominee, for breakfast in the Senate dining room on Tuesday morning.  One thing apparently not on the menu is a chance that Mr. Grassley and his fellow Republicans will take up the nomination, convene hearings or hold a confirmation vote.  Mr. Grassley has said that the purpose of the meeting is to explain that reality to Judge Garland in person. Democrats have tried to suggest that Mr. Grassley’s willingness to meet at all emphasizes his unease over Republican leaders’ refusal to consider any nominee for the court during a presidential election year.  Before the breakfast and additional meetings this week between Mr. Garland and other Republican senators, the White House sought to increase the pressure on Monday in demanding for hearings and a vote.   “After having those meetings, I think it — an obvious question will be begged of those Republican senators,” the White House press secretary, Josh Earnest, said at his daily news briefing. “And it’s simply this: If you’ve had an opportunity to hear from Chief Judge Garland directly, why shouldn’t your constituents?”  Mr. Earnest was happy to answer his own question: “They’re concerned about giving him that opportunity because, if they do, it will be clear to the American public that he’s deserving of a lifetime appointment on the Supreme Court. And it is going to make it a lot harder for them to justify blocking it.”  Senate Republican leaders say the vacancy will be filled by whoever wins the presidency in November.
