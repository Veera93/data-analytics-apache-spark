 Ben Ginsberg, a top Republican lawyer who has long served as the lead presidential debate negotiator for his party, will attend a private meeting Sunday evening in Washington of Republican presidential campaigns hoping to overhaul the primary debate process.  Mr. Ginsberg, who is not currently affiliated with a campaign, was invited to serve as a facilitator, helping to ensure a smooth, civil discussion, according to a Republican strategist familiar with the plans. After Wednesday evening’s CNBC debate in Boulder, Colo.,  many campaigns were upset with what they felt was the snarky tone of the moderators and questions, and  tensions erupted at both the Republican National Committee and NBC-affiliated networks. The R.N.C., in a damage control maneuver, on Friday suspended its next debate with NBC News and its sister network, Telemundo. And the Republican campaigns organized a private meeting this weekend to strategize about ways to regain control of the debate process. The agenda, however, remains fluid, with different campaigns hoping for different outcomes. Ben Carson, the retired pediatric neurosurgeon whose campaign has spearheaded the meeting, is calling for fewer debates (roughly one per month), with  all of the candidates included on stage and more time for opening and closing statements. Other campaigns, like those of Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Gov. Bobby Jindal of Louisiana, who are lower in the polls and have been relegated to the undercard debate, are simply eager for a prime-time debate slot. One suggestion under consideration is holding two prime-time debates, of roughly 90-minutes each, with seven candidates — chosen randomly — in each.
