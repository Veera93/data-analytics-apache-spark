 The week before the last Democratic presidential debate of the year began with Senator Bernie Sanders’s campaign pulling a negative digital ad it was running against Hillary Clinton after reporters caught wind of it. Mr. Sanders, who has said with pride that he doesn’t run negative ads, nonetheless had a digital spot describing Mrs. Clinton as someone backed by “big money interests.” The incident was in many ways emblematic of the quandary his campaign has faced for the past several months. The ad was pulled after reporters began asking about it. Aides blamed the spot on a misunderstanding. But the episode raises the question of how aggressively the presidential hopeful will go at Mrs. Clinton, who is leading almost every Democratic primary poll, in Saturday night’s debate in New Hampshire. Martin O’Malley, who has been struggling for oxygen in the race, was aggressive in the second Democratic debate in criticizing Mrs. Clinton, and has been similarly abrasive with Mr. Sanders. But Mr. Sanders has struggled with where to draw the distinction between “contrasts” and attacks. During the debate on Saturday, which comes after the San Bernardino, Calif., terrorist assault, he has the chance to suggest that Mrs. Clinton, who has been far more hawkish, is a poor fit for the Democratic Party. Mrs. Clinton must walk a line between supporting President Obama and laying out her case for a strong response against a new strain of terrorist threat. Mrs. Clinton gave a major speech on national security this week, giving her a foundation heading into the debate. But with a national mood that still doesn’t favor lengthy entanglements overseas, she will need to tread carefully.
