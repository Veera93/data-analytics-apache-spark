 “Super Tuesday” isn’t just for presidential campaigns: It is also the year’s first set of congressional primaries. And some senior Republican lawmakers are trying to make sure they are not the next Eric Cantor or Richard G. Lugar, established Capitol Hill powers knocked off from the right in a preliminary round. Senator Richard C. Shelby, the 81-year-old Alabama Republican, has dropped millions of dollars on television campaign ads in his most aggressive effort in decades, fearing that voters driven by Donald J. Trump’s outsider campaign could also reject down-ballot insiders like himself. Mr. Shelby is a fixture in the Senate. He is the current chairman of the Banking Committee, and in line to lead the Appropriations Committee. He has studiously tried to avoid any actions in recent months that could backfire, even opposing a huge spending bill he helped write to deny his Republican challengers ammunition. If he cannot break 50 percent, he would face an April 12 runoff. In Texas, two senior House Republicans, Representatives Kevin Brady and Pete Sessions, face challengers who say the men have been in Washington too long, a message that could resonate with voters in a state where both Mr. Trump and Ted Cruz, the home-state senator, could do well on Tuesday. Mr. Brady is chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, while Mr. Sessions leads the Rules Committee, two important posts. But that influence might not count for much with voters eager to shake up the nation’s capital. Both men need to break 50 percent to skirt a May 24 runoff. On the other end of the spectrum, Representative Louie Gohmert, a hard-right Texas Republican, has attracted his first primary opposition in a decade from challengers who say he spends too much time waging political fights, does not deliver for his district and is an embarrassment to his state.
