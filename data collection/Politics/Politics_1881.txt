 For Jim Webb, this week’s Democratic presidential debate turned into a choice of getting mad or being mute. He chose mad, and on Thursday he explained why he appeared so peeved on the stage in Las Vegas. “It was rigged in terms of who was going to get time on the floor,” Mr. Webb, a former senator from Virginia, said during a forum at the Council on Foreign Relations. “It’s very difficult to win a debate if you don’t get the opportunity to speak.” Mr. Webb spoke for about 15 minutes during the two-hour debate hosted by CNN. He spent some of those minutes complaining about his lack of time, especially when compared with the attention given to Hillary Rodham Clinton and Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont.  But Anderson Cooper, the moderator, advised Mr. Webb that he was wasting precious time by complaining. “The debate was being portrayed as a showdown between Mrs. Clinton and Bernie,” Mr. Webb said on Thursday. “I even turned around to Bernie Sanders at one point and said ‘Bernie, say my name.'” Mr. Webb, a military veteran and an accomplished author, noted that he did well in several online polls after the debate and was pleased that he had made the most of his time. His most memorable moment was when he boasted of killing an enemy as a Marine in Vietnam. However, Mr. Webb rejects the notion that he is not a happy warrior. “In that kind of environment, it was either going to be Mr. Angry or a potted plant,” Mr. Webb said of his debate performance.
