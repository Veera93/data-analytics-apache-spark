 Jeb Bush raised $13.4 million during the three months ending Sept. 30, his campaign announced on Thursday afternoon, the second-largest total in the Republican field but a sharp drop-off from the first weeks of his campaign. Mr. Bush’s total — eagerly awaited by rival campaigns this week — indicates he spent nearly four out of every five dollars he raised during the third quarter of the year, a period in which establishment candidates struggled to win over donors and Mr. Bush’s campaign embarked on belt-tightening measures to ensure it would remain solvent through the fall. He began October with about $10.27 million in cash on hand, less than Ben Carson, Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, and Senator Marco Rubio of Florida, according to figures released by the campaign.
