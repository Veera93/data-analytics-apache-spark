 With her preferred candidate, Marco Rubio, out of the race, Gov. Nikki R. Haley of South Carolina threw her support to Ted Cruz on Wednesday, calling him “solid and strong.” In contrast to the splashy endorsement of Mr. Rubio before her state’s primary last month, Ms. Haley delivered the news almost off-hand as she took questions from reporters in Columbia, S.C, the state capital. “My hope and my prayer is that Senator Cruz can pull through this and that he can push through and really get to where he needs to go,” Ms. Haley said. “Because we do want a strong leader, we do want somebody that’s conservative, we do want somebody that’s action-minded. So we’ll see what happens.” She said there were no further plans for an endorsement announcement with more fanfare for Mr. Cruz, the Texas senator. “I don’t know that I need to formally endorse,” she said. “If anybody asks me, that’s what I want to see happen.” When asked, she added that she expected to support the Republican nominee in the fall, even if it is Donald J. Trump.
