 Senate Republicans on Tuesday will take aim at an Obama administration rule on the environment that has become a leading target of conservatives who see it as the latest example of the administration’s executive overreach. Senator John Barrasso of Wyoming, a member of the Republican leadership, will get a procedural vote on Tuesday afternoon on his bill requiring the Environmental Protection Agency to scrap its Waters of the United States rule and to consult landowners to come up with a more acceptable version. The administration and conservation groups say the rule, known as WOTUS, will clear up some legal ambiguity and lead to cleaner water. Conservatives say it is far too broad and could lead to the government asserting jurisdiction over small bodies of water on private property, reducing the value of the land and causing unnecessary bureaucratic meddling. The rule has become a rallying point for conservatives nationwide, and Senate Republicans are already preparing another line of attack should Mr. Barraso’s proposal, which has some support from red-state Democrats, fall short. Whatever happens, it is clear that POTUS has not heard the last of Republican opposition to WOTUS.
