 The Republican National Committee, facing a suddenly unwieldy process as states begin to select delegates at their own conventions, has hired two veteran strategists to help out, officials said. The hires of Chris LaCivita and Steve Munisteri — a former top adviser to Senator Rand Paul’s presidential effort and a former supporter of Mr. Paul, respectively — came as the party braces for a series of state conventions ahead of the national one in Cleveland starting on July 18.  “The R.N.C. is adding staff in the political and legal departments to aid in the effort,” a statement from the party committee said as officials rolled out a new grass-roots operation to assist state delegations. “Veteran G.O.P. operatives Chris LaCivita and Steve Munisteri will also help with the initiative and will work alongside former Oklahoma G.O.P. Chairman and current R.N.C. State Party Director Matt Pinnell.”  Mr. Pinnell has worked with the committee for the last few years. But Mr. LaCivita and Mr. Munisteri, a former chairman of the Texas Republican Party, adds heft and experience to the committee’s work.  Last week, Donald J. Trump, the party’s front-runner, complained about having his delegates “stolen” at various state conventions despite his victories in the nominating contests. But Mr. Trump’s team did little to combat those efforts.
