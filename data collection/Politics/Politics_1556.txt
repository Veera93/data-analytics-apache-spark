 Senator David Vitter lost his governorâ€™s race in Louisiana on Saturday, but Senate Democrats might have suffered a defeat as well. Democrats were hoping that if Mr. Vitter, a Republican, lost his bid for governor he would try to remain in the Senate and seek re-election next year. The thinking was that a wounded Mr. Vitter, his campaign treasury drained, would be a ripe opportunity for Democrats to try to pick up a red-state Senate seat. But Mr. Vitter quickly announced that he was done, and Republicans could have a much easier time defending an open Senate seat. There are plenty of available candidates, including Representatives Charles Boustany Jr. and John Fleming, who had been seen as possible replacements for Mr. Vitter had he won, along with Rob Maness, a Tea Party-backed conservative who mounted a strong challenge in 2014 before losing in the primary. Democrats were eager to try to talk Mayor Mitch Landrieu of New Orleans into a race against Mr. Vitter, and he seemed to be weighing the idea. But a Senate contest without Mr. Vitter is a different calculation, and Mr. Landrieu might well decide to give it a pass.
