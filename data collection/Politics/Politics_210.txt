 If Senator Ted Cruz’s presidential campaign had any doubts that Indiana is a do-or-die state, simply look to the ad budgets. The Cruz campaign has already spent $1.1 million on television ads in the state, days ahead of Tuesday’s voting in the Indiana primary, and has reserved at least another $400,000 in airtime, according to multiple media buyers tracking the election. The campaign just released a new ad, likening the positions of Donald J. Trump to Hillary Clinton on issues like gun control, abortion and noting his donations to Democratic campaigns in the past. The “super PAC” supporting his campaign, Trusted Leadership PAC, pledged to spend $1.6 million in the state, and has already gone through about $1.2 million of it. Our Principles PAC, the super PAC whose sole purpose is halting Mr. Trump’s march to the Republican nomination, has spent about $1.2 million in the state, mostly on an ad titled “Scam,” which focuses on Trump University, a failed former business of the Manhattan real estate mogul that is being sued by the New York attorney general. And Club for Growth, which has also been advertising heavily to stop Mr. Trump, has spent nearly $1 million in the state. That political action committee’s ad, however, titled “Math,” also goes after Mr. Kasich, proclaiming Mr. Cruz as the only candidate who has the chance to stop Mr. Trump. Mr. Kasich’s campaign and the super PAC supporting his candidacy, New Day for America, have not been advertising in Indiana in recent weeks, evidence that at least part of the pact agreed to by the Cruz and Kasich teams to divide up final states to stop Mr. Trump is being honored. Mr. Trump, for his part, has spent more than $700,000 of his own in the state, running a new ad that features his son, Donald Trump Jr., talking about his father’s “tough guy” persona.
