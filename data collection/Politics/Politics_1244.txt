 Ted Cruz is on a six-day, 28-town swing through Iowa. These are the places, faces and culinary selections of 2016’s first proper bus tour.
 EVENT 7 Time: 2:47 p.m., Jan. 5 Place: Cherokee, Iowa (population: 5,253) Site: Danny’s Sports Spot, a multiroom bar-and-grill brightened by an oversize illuminated Miller Lite can jutting from the ceiling. Food: supreme nachos, cheezy soup, chimichanga Mood: seated applause, respectful laughter Situational Cruz comedy: Mr. Cruz, chuckling at the reporters packed behind the bar, made an offer on behalf of a particular news outlet. “I’m pleased to tell you,” he informed the crowd, “there’ll be free drinks on the house, and The New York Times is picking up the bill.” Highlight: Mr. Cruz, who has been traveling with Representative Steve King, a key Iowa supporter, returned to a favorite faux King anecdote. It has a long wind-up. “An awful lot of kids, when they go to bed at night, they wear Superman pajamas,” he began. “Well, Superman, he wears Chuck Norris pajamas. And Chuck Norris wears Steve King pajamas.” Moderate giggling followed.
