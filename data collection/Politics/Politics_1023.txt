 Rick Perry, the former Texas governor, endorsed Senator Ted Cruz on Monday, trumpeting his “willingness to take on the Washington cartel.” Mr. Perry, who ended his own run for president in September, said his state’s junior senator was “ready to serve as commander in chief on Day 1.” The endorsement, reported by Politico on Monday, comes two days after another high-profile announcement of support for Mr. Cruz by Glenn Beck, the radio host. Mr. Cruz called Mr. Perry “a friend and a remarkable public servant,” praising his economic stewardship of Texas. Mr. Cruz also served under Mr. Perry as the state’s solicitor general.
