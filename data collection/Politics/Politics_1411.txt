 Protesters angry at Donald J. Trump’s call to ban foreign Muslims from entering the United States disrupted his appearance on Friday in midtown Manhattan, and security guards forcibly ejected several of the demonstrators. Jamila Hammami, the executive director of the Queer Detainee Empowerment Project, said she was one of the protesters who were thrown out. She said that her hair was pulled and that security guards told her they would throw her down the stairs. One video showed a female demonstrator tumbling to the ground after apparently being pushed toward the door by security officers. Mr. Trump was there as the keynote speaker for the Pennsylvania Republican Party’s annual Commonwealth Club fund-raiser luncheon at the Plaza Hotel. Such disruptions have become increasingly common at Mr. Trump’s events in recent weeks, with several breaking out at a rally Monday in South Carolina. Attendees at the lunch Friday said there had been maybe four or five protesters. Dick Stewart, a co-chairman of the central caucus for Pennsylvania Republicans, said Mr. Trump seemed unfazed by the disruption. One protester, Jacob Bridge, said that he had bought a $1,000 ticket to the event with the intent of letting in more protesters once he was inside, but that he was escorted out before he had the chance to do so. Mr. Bridge, a former Marine and member of Iraq Veterans Against the War, said he was approached by security guards shortly after he sat down. He said he didn’t know how security knew about his intentions, and he said he was told that he’d be refunded the amount of his ticket.
