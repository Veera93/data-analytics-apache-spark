 New Hampshire residents are notoriously protective of their first-in-the-nation primary status and quite sensitive to suggestions that their state might not be the most representative of the 50. Senator Harry Reid, the Democratic leader, is notoriously plain-spoken about things that irk him.  Those two realities collided this week as New Hampshirites of both parties took offense at Mr. Reid’s suggestion that New Hampshire was neither diverse enough nor populated enough to serve such an important presidential selection function. “You go to New Hampshire, there are not any minorities there, and nobody lives there,” Mr. Reid said in a public interview with Paul Kane of The Washington Post in an event held in conjunction with the Democratic presidential debate in Las Vegas. Well, somebody lives there, including Senator Kelly Ayotte, a Republican who faces a tough re-election fight against Gov. Maggie Hassan, a Democrat, in one of the marquee Senate battles of 2016. On Wednesday, Ms. Ayotte’s campaign sought to cash in on Mr. Reid’s comment, circulating a fund-raising email that asks donors to “kick in $5 for a senator who knows New Hampshire represents America’s best!” Ms. Hassan and Senator Jeanne Shaheen, Ms. Ayotte’s Democratic colleague, also took umbrage with the statement by Mr. Reid, who offered a grudging apology. Mr. Reid is retiring and not running for re-election next year, raising the prospect that his more unrestrained and unfiltered comments could spice up races around the nation as Democrats try to win the Senate back.
