 Hoping to restore momentum for a criminal justice overhaul, Senate sponsors of the legislation plan to go public on Thursday with the names of new Republican supporters and the changes made in the package to appease party critics. The package reducing mandatory minimum sentences has been stalled in the Senate for months after some conservative Republicans, including Senators Tom Cotton of Arkansas and Jeff Sessions of Alabama, raised objections, splitting the party. Republican authors of the bill, including Senators Mike Lee of Utah, Charles E. Grassley of Iowa and John Cornyn of Texas, have been reaching out to try to win the backing of other Republicans to demonstrate to Senator Mitch McConnell, the Kentucky Republican and majority leader, that the bipartisan measure has strong support on both sides of the aisle. Among the changes made to win converts were steps to deny anyone convicted of a serious violent felony from qualifying for a reduced sentence and keeping current sentencing guidelines in place for those considered armed career criminals. Mr. McConnell has made no commitment to bring the measure to the floor, and he was hoping to spend much of the Senateâ€™s time this spring and summer on annual spending bills. But a new dispute over the first spending measure to hit the floor may send the majority leader looking for something else to fill the time. The planned announcements by the backers of the criminal justice package came after the National District Attorneys Association endorsed the legislation this week.
