 Jim Webb, the former senator from Virginia, may be through with the Democratic Party. The presidential candidate, who complained of not getting enough time to talk at last week’s debate, is considering running as an independent, according to his campaign. Mr. Webb will hold a 1 p.m. news conference on Tuesday at the National Press Club in Washington to “discuss his candidacy, the campaign and his views of the political parties in the current election cycle.” A Reagan-era secretary of the Navy who was once a Republican, Mr. Webb kicked off his campaign in July but has been largely invisible on the trail and barely registers in polls of Democratic voters. Mr. Webb is a longtime critic of the Iraq war, but his views on energy, guns and national security are appealing to some Republicans. At the debate last week, he raised some eyebrows when he boasted of having killed an enemy while serving as a Marine in Vietnam and by confronting the moderator, CNN’s Anderson Cooper, on the lack of questions directed his way. “It was rigged in terms of who was going to get time on the floor,” Mr. Webb said at a forum at the Council on Foreign Relations after the debate. “It’s very difficult to win a debate if you don’t get the opportunity to speak.”
