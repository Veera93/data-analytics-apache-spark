 Senator Ted Cruz, ascending in state and national polls on the strength of social conservative support, won two more endorsements on Wednesday, including the backing of the National Organization for Marriage. The group, central in legal fights against same-sex marriage, called Mr. Cruz “a proven champion for marriage and religious freedom and someone we can absolutely count on to fight to restore marriage to our nation’s laws.” Mr. Cruz, the Texas senator, also received the support of Richard A. Viguerie, a longtime conservative activist who, in 2012, supported former Senator Rick Santorum of Pennsylvania, the Iowa caucus winner. In a field featuring several social conservatives, including Ben Carson, former Gov. Mike Huckabee of Arkansas and Mr. Santorum, Mr. Cruz’s team is hoping that assembling a unified group of important endorsers will prove particularly potent in this cycle. Mr. Cruz has already been endorsed by Representative Steve King of Iowa and is hoping to earn the support of Bob Vander Plaats, a leader of the Christian right in Iowa, who is scheduled to hold an event on Thursday announcing his choice. Mr. Cruz was among several candidates who signed a pledge for the National Organization for Marriage, which included a commitment to work to overturn the Supreme Court’s ruling affirming same-sex marriage as a right. The organization’s president, Brian Brown, said that unifying around Mr. Cruz was particularly significant because “there is a real danger that conservatives will split the vote, allowing someone like Donald Trump to emerge from the crowded field, which would be disastrous.” Mr. Viguerie similarly called Mr. Cruz “the only candidate who can unite the conservative coalition” in both a primary and general election. “To conservatives who continue to window-shop I say, ‘What are you waiting for?’” Mr. Viguerie said.
