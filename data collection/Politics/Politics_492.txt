 Fox News announced Monday that it would host the next Republican debate, but who will be on stage remains an open question.  The debate is scheduled for next Monday in Salt Lake City, with Bret Baier, Megyn Kelly and Chris Wallace as the moderators.  But Donald J. Trump has said that “we had enough debates,” and stated in a news conference on Friday that he thought that the CNN debate the night before was the last one. He indicated that he might still participate if the networks gave money to veterans’ causes, a demand he has made before previous Fox debates, even skipping one before the Iowa caucus to hold a rally for veterans. A spokeswoman for the Trump campaign did not immediately respond to requests for comment.  The stage could also shrink on its own. Before the debate next week, major primaries are being held Tuesday in Florida, Illinois, Missouri, North Carolina and Ohio.  Gov. John Kasich of Ohio has indicated that if he does not win his home state, he will quit the race. And Senator Marco Rubio of Florida would have a difficult path ahead if he cannot win there on Tuesday.
