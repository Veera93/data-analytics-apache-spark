 Ted Cruz is on a six-day, 28-town swing through Iowa. These are the places, faces and culinary selections of 2016’s first proper bus tour. EVENT 11 Time: 2:48 p.m., Jan. 6 Place: Spirit Lake, Iowa (population: 4,840) Site: Godfather’s Pizza, in a side room with four decorative pizza pans mounted on the wall. Mood: Fired-up adults, fussy children Food: Da Boss’ bruschetta pizza, bacon cheeseburger pizza, Mozza-loaded pizza crust Company pledge (delivered via decorative pizza pan): “Skimpy toppings? Not now. Not ever.” Technical difficulties: For the second time this trip, Mr. Cruz coyly blamed the Obama administration for technical issues. (This time, the lights briefly flickered off.) Highlight: Mr. Cruz, asked about gun rights, offered a tale of a Texas woman he said he knew who had been pulled over by a police officer. Woman: “Officer, I need to tell you, I’ve got a Glock here strapped on my hip. And I’ve got a .38-revolver in my boot over here. And I’ve got a double-barrel shotgun under the seat over here. And I’ve actually got a single-shot derringer in my other boot.” Officer: “Goodness gracious, what on earth are you afraid of?” Woman: “Not a dang thing.”
