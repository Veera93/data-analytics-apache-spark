 BEAUFORT, S.C. — Jeb Bush has largely refrained from attacking Senator Marco Rubio of Florida by name on the campaign trail. But fighting for his political life ahead of the primary Saturday in South Carolina, a state with a large population of active military members and veterans, Mr. Bush took issue with comments Mr. Rubio  made questioning his foreign policy experience.  “I know what it is to be commander in chief,” Mr. Bush said, referring to his time as governor of Florida, where he oversaw his state’s National Guard. “I know what it is to lead.”  “And for someone who has no experience at all to suggest I don’t — having lived overseas, having worked overseas, developing relationships with leaders overseas, being governor of the fourth-largest state and being a commander-in-chief of the Florida national guard,” Mr. Bush said. “With all due respect Senator Rubio, your four years or five years or whatever it is as senator does not match up to my capabilities of understanding how the world works.” Speaking on CNN last week, Mr. Rubio was blunt in his criticism of Mr. Bush. “The fact of the matter is, Jeb has no foreign policy experience,” Mr. Rubio said. “He has no foreign policy experience and was governor a long time ago. The world has changed a lot in the last 10 years.”
