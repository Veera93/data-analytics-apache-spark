 Members of the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday will get a prime opportunity to air their grievances over the handling of the Supreme Court vacancy when the panel gathers for its first business meeting since the death of Justice Antonin Scalia last month. Senator Charles E. Grassley, the Iowa Republican who leads the panel bitterly divided over whether to take up President Obama’s coming nominee, said on Wednesday that he expected a full-blown debate at the session. Democrats will no doubt be happy to oblige him. Democratic members of the panel, which would be the first stop for a nominee, have expressed their displeasure with Mr. Grassley, taking him to task for announcing that the committee would not take up any nomination. Mr. Grassley and his Republican colleagues have fought back with examples of how in past presidential election years top Democrats threatened to block high court nominees by Republican presidents. On Thursday, the combatants will be at close quarters for the discussion. An earlier business meeting scheduled for last week was canceled when Democrats objected to Mr. Grassley’s proposal to hold it in a room off the Senate floor, which would have limited attendance from the news media and the public. It is very doubtful that anything will be settled at the session, but it will give both sides a chance to sharpen their arguments for what Mr. Grassley suggested will be a drawn-out dispute. “Whether it is today or tomorrow or whether it is over the next seven or eight months, this is a very important debate we ought to have about the Constitution,” he said.
