 Donald J. Trump said last month that he was prepared to “go to war” with Senator Ted Cruz if the Republican from Texas continued to gain strength. It appears the fight is on. On Friday, after Mr. Cruz told a private gathering of donors that Mr. Trump’s campaign was destined to collapse, the billionaire developer dared him to challenge him publicly. — Donald J.

I believe gravity will bring both of those campaigns down,” Mr. Cruz said. “The lion’s share of their supporters come to us.”  Mr. Cruz has been gaining in the polls and in one Iowa survey has overtaken Mr. Trump. On Thursday the Texas senator received an important endorsement from Bob Van Der Plaats, the chief executive of the Family Leader, an influential evangelical Christian organization. The two rivals have largely been cordial to each other, with Mr. Trump professing to be a fan of Mr. Cruz and Mr. Cruz saying that Mr. Trump has brought important issues to the forefront of the race. But Mr. Trump has proved to be an aggressive counterpuncher and presumably could raise questions about Mr. Cruz’s rich donors and his opposition to the National Security Agency’s metadata program. Mr. Trump made clear that he considered Mr. Cruz’s remarks as an attack and warned that he would regret the decision. — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 11, 2015
