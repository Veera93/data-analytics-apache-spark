 It was hard to escape the conclusion that Elton John and Katy Perry are worried about Donald J. Trump. In a bedazzled show of pop force on Wednesday night, the singers all but pleaded with an audience of high-rolling Democratic donors at Radio City Music Hall to put Hillary Clinton in the White House. The alternative, they suggested, was unthinkable. “This is a very important year for America,” Mr. John said from behind a grand piano, his sequined blue jacket shimmering under the glow of a spotlight. “And she’s the only hope you have.” At that, the audience at the concert, which featured the entire Clinton clan — Hillary, Bill and Chelsea – roared. Ms. Perry, outfitted, sparingly and revealingly, in the colors of the American flag, offered an elaborate metaphor that seemed aimed at Mr. Trump’s chosen profession of real estate development and his stubbornly vague plans for the presidency. “Don’t you wanna see a blueprint before you build a house you are going to put your family in?” Ms. Perry asked the packed house of around 5,000 at the primary fund-raiser. On a night when speechmaking was kept to a minimum, both singers acted as political stand-ins and activists (for fighting AIDS, in the case of Mr. John, and championing women’s rights, in the case of Ms. Perry). Both dedicated a single song to Mrs. Clinton, who spoke briefly and then went backstage: “I’m Still Standing,” a ballad of endurance by Mr. John, and “Unconditionally,” a song of tolerance by Ms. Perry. Mr. Trump’s name was never uttered. Yet Ms. Perry, especially, seemed to keep finding oblique ways to compare him with Mrs. Clinton. “She’s not just sayin’ stuff. Or contradicting herself,” Ms. Perry said. She paused to utter a phrase familiar to her New York audience: “Oy. Vey.” The audience erupted into laughter. She left them with this Trumpian-sounding assurance of a Trump failure. “It’s not going to get scary,” Ms. Perry said, “because we are going to take control.”
