 Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. on Tuesday added his voice to the chorus of condemnation of Donald J. Trump’s vow to temporarily bar Muslims from entering the country, calling it a “very, very dangerous brew for America” and predicting that if Mr. Trump wins the Republican nomination, Hillary Clinton would beat him “in a walk.” In an interview with Bloomberg News on Air Force Two returning from a visit to Ukraine, Mr. Biden said he did not “know what his motive is” but suggested that Mr. Trump, a former reality show star, was saying things he does not believe to gain attention. “Is this a guy doing ‘Celebrity Apprentice’ for himself?” Mr. Biden asked. “Is this just a guy who’s an entertainer? It may have started there, but I now think now he wants to be president. But I don’t think there’s much chance of that.” Mr. Biden added that “I believe he’s smart enough to know half of what he’s saying makes no sense.”
