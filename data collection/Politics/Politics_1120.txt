 Tom Steyer, the billionaire environmental activist who invested heavily in the 2014 midterm elections, is joining forces with the Latino Victory Fund, the Democratic-leaning group that aims to elect Hispanics to higher office, a shift in approach for the 2016 elections.  Mr. Steyer will become one of the new chairmen for the group, along with Representative Joaquin Castro, a Democrat from Texas, Antonio Villaraigosa, the former mayor of Los Angeles, and Melissa Mark-Viverito, New York’s City Council speaker.  He will join the group as it is making a heavy push in the 2016 presidential elections to influence Hispanic voters, who are a key group in the Democratic coalition and who Latino Victory officials describe as disproportionately affected by environmental problems. Latino Victory is facing opposition in its efforts to court Hispanic voters from the Libre Initiative, a project financed by the political operation of the conservative oil magnates Charles and David Koch.  Mr. Steyer spent about $74 million trying to impact the outcome of the 2014 midterms, money that ultimately did not sway the results in Democrats’ favor.  Cristobal J. Alex, the group’s president, said that Mr. Steyer’s presence helps highlight the degree to which climate change and environmental concerns are significant to Hispanic voters.  “We know that our community cares deeply about this issue,” he said, saying that Hispanic voters are underrepresented among elected officials.  Sky Gallegos, the executive vice president of political strategy for NextGen Climate, the advocacy group that Mr. Steyer helped found and heavily finance, will also work with Latino Victory. She said NextGen had worked to conduct outreach to Hispanic voters, making the partnership a natural fit.
