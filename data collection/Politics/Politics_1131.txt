 The disarray within Ben Carson’s campaign continued Thursday as his campaign’s finance chairman abruptly resigned hours before Republican presidential candidates were set to gather in South Carolina for a debate. The Carson campaign did not offer an explanation as to why Dean Parker, a telecommunications entrepreneur, was departing and praised the job he did building the Carson fund-raising organization from scratch into a juggernaut. The resignation comes after Politico reported that Mr. Parker was paying himself a salary of $20,000 per month, which is unusually high for such a position. “While current allegations toward me are misrepresentations, my primary goal is to help Dr. Carson save our nation. I am excited about the growing momentum behind him and look forward to even greater days ahead,” Mr. Parker said in a statement.  The departure follows other resignations among the retired neurosurgeon’s campaign leadership team, which has experienced upheaval as his poll numbers have dropped precipitously in recent months amid questions about his knowledge of foreign policy and scrutiny of elements of his own life story.  Mr. Carson said Mr. Parker was a “valued member” of the campaign and called him a trusted friend.
