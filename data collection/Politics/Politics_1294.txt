 Donald J. Trump scored another first in the 2016 presidential race on Tuesday evening — he held a news conference aboard his private jet just before a rally in Iowa, to announce he is about to spend heavily on the campaign.  How heavily? It’ll be huge, Mr. Trump assured reporters, saying he will spend $2 million a week in Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina on television ads.  Whether that meant in each state, or $2 million over all in the three, was unclear. But the distinction is significant; $2 million a week per state would be saturation level, and virtually impossible in New Hampshire, where the airwaves are already cluttered.  But $2 million a week in the three is a moderate-level advertising buy for a candidate and is about what most of the other candidates are spending. Candidates pay substantially lower rates than “super PACs” do for their airtime.  Still, Mr. Trump has yet to reserve the television time, according to two independent media buyers. His media-buying firm, Strategic Media, placed time for the radio buy that Mr. Trump did in the three states earlier this year.  It’s not clear what Mr. Trump is waiting for in terms of his ad buy. But the suspense he has managed to generate over whether he will commit to a fairly basic campaign function has dominated the campaign for the last day.  In Council Bluffs, Mr. Trump took another veiled swipe at Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, who is leading him in some recent Iowa polls and who appears to have momentum. “To the best of my knowledge, not too many evangelicals come out of Cuba, okay?” Mr. Trump told the crowd. “Just remember that, okay?” Evangelicals play a significant role in the Iowa caucuses. If Mr. Trump loses, it heightens the significance of New Hampshire for his math. He allowed at one point in his speech that he could finish in the top four and be happy, but then quickly said he wants to win Iowa and that the media would say he lost no matter how close to first place he came.
