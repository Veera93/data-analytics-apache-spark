 Donald J. Trump met privately with Gov. Mike Pence of Indiana at his residence on Wednesday afternoon, two weeks before the primary in a state that Senator Ted Cruz’s campaign sees as crucial to its efforts to capture the Republican presidential nomination. Mr. Trump and Mr. Pence were joined by Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey, a supporter of Mr. Trump and a former head of the Republican Governors Association, according to an aide to Mr. Trump.  The meeting represents a markedly different approach by Mr. Trump to winning a conservative state, one that is likely more hospitable to Mr. Cruz. In Wisconsin, Mr. Trump never reached out to Gov. Scott Walker, a former rival who ultimately backed Mr. Cruz. Mr. Pence is viewed as one of his party’s truest conservative voices, and he had considered a presidential run of his own. Mr. Trump could be a difficult fit for Mr. Pence to endorse, but establishing a connection could prevent the governor from endorsing Mr. Cruz in the primary.
