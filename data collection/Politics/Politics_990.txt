 DECORAH, Iowa – Hillary Clinton is sometimes asked what kind of people she would want to put on the Supreme Court – but not who. During a campaign event here in northeast Iowa on Tuesday, one attendee had a nominee in mind: President Obama. Would she name him? Laughing with apparent delight as the audience cheered, Mrs. Clinton said: “Wow, what a great idea. Nobody has ever suggested that to me. Wow. I love that.” She then repeated “wow” again, as if giving herself an extra second to think of a good answer, considering that she has been praising Mr. Obama’s agenda and leadership repeatedly on the campaign trail recently. “He may have a few other things to do, but I tell you, that’s a great idea,” Mrs. Clinton said — not quite committing but certainly not dismissing the notion.  She then turned to the current court, saying that “we need new justices who actually understand the challenges we face” and wondering if some justices made decisions based on “naïveté.”
