 Senator Marco Rubio is ready for an onslaught of attacks from Jeb Bush, and ahead of Tuesday night’s Republican presidential debate he offered a preview of the comeback that he may use should Mr. Bush go on the offensive. In a pre-emptive strike, Mr. Rubio’s campaign unveiled an advertisement on Tuesday that shows Mr. Bush showering his longtime friend with praise. Suggesting that Mr. Bush’s new criticism of Mr. Rubio, who he once mentored, is “phony,” the ad seeks to neutralize any damage that Mr. Bush might be able to inflict by using the former Florida governor’s own words against him. “I’m a huge Marco fan,” Mr. Bush said in one clip. “He’s probably the most articulate conservative on the scene today.” During another sequence, Mr. Bush expresses pride in Mr. Rubio, lauding his hopeful and optimistic message and describing the senator as energetic and eloquent. Mr. Bush tried to go after Mr. Rubio at last month’s debate for missing votes in the Senate. But the attempt backfired, when Mr. Rubio said that Mr. Bush was just using the advice of campaign consultants in hopes of rehabilitating his candidacy. The Times reported on Monday that the cash-rich group that is aiding Mr. Bush’s White House bid is preparing a fresh line of attacks against Mr. Rubio that will focus on his hard-line stand against abortion. However, neither Mr. Bush nor the “super PAC” backing him have yet to take on Mr. Rubio in an aggressive manner. If he does take a tougher approach with Mr. Rubio, Mr. Bush’s risks appearing insincere and faces potential blowback from Republicans who do not want to see a rising star in the party damaged. — Bill Kristol (@BillKristol) November 10, 2015
