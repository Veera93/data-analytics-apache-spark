 Gun-safety legislation is unlikely to pass with Republicans in control of Congress, but Senate Democrats will begin their push on Thursday morning.  Senator Chuck Schumer of New York will be joined by senators from states including Connecticut, Oregon and Virginia to share the outlines of a plan to reduce gun violence. While there will be no legislation introduced as of yet, they will propose measures to strengthen background checks, close loopholes and stem sales of illegal guns. Democrats acknowledge that passing new gun laws will be difficult, but they say they hope to rally public support for action and pressure Republicans who oppose them. Legislation could be proposed more formally after the next recess. Senator Harry Reid will not be in attendance on Thursday, as he is attending a funeral of a longtime staff member, but he wrote a letter to his colleagues urging them to fight to get something done.  “Inaction is not an option as we have witnessed the consequences of inaction too often,” Mr. Reid wrote.
