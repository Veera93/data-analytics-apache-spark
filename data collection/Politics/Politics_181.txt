 Donald J. Trump is perhaps the most prolific user of Twitter in political history. But as he tries to put a stranglehold on the Republican nomination with a victory Tuesday in Indiana, he is putting up some of his own money to increase his reach on Twitter. Or, to put that in a more 140-character-friendly way: Mr. Trump is paying to promote some of his posts on Twitter. Mr. Trump’s campaign has joined Twitter’s regional ad targeting, having four of his posts  appear in the feeds of selected Twitter users in Indiana, regardless of whether they are followers of the candidate. In a sign of growing technical sophistication within the Trump campaign, the Twitter posts are being aimed at particular audiences within the state. For example, a post with a video featuring the endorsement of Bobby Knight, theformer Indiana University basketball coach, was targeted at basketball fans as identified by Twitter. — Donald J.

Mr. Cruz is opting for a slightly different targeting strategy. With a Twitter voice less pronounced than his rival’s, Mr. Cruz is letting others do the talking for him. Rather than promoting his own posts on Twitter, his campaign is paying to promote endorsement posts from Gov. Mike Pence of Indiana and Gov. Scott Walker of Wisconsin. — Mike Pence (@mike_pence) May 2, 2016  — Scott Walker (@ScottWalker) April 30, 2016
