 Donald J. Trump this week dismissed questions about an advertisement that features women reciting some of his past words about female physical appearances, including insults, calling the remarks “show business.” In an interview with Wolf Blitzer on CNN on Monday, Mr. Trump responded to the ads from Our Principles PAC, which was formed with the sole purpose of stopping his march to the Republican nomination. The ad features women reading previous quotations from Mr. Trump on Howard Stern’s radio show in which he mused about the size of a woman’s breasts being reflective of her overall appearance, as well as his criticism of the comedian Rosie O’Donnell. Asked if his words were coming back to haunt him, Mr. Trump replied: “No. I think people understand. I think people — first of all, half of that was show business.”  Some of the lines came from his former show, “The Apprentice,” he said. “Look, these politicians, I know them,” Mr. Trump said. “They say far worse when they’re in closed doors or where they’re with a group of people that they trust. This — a lot of that is show business stuff.” Did he feel that way about women, Mr. Blitzer asked? “Of course not. Nobody respects women more than I do,” he said. “Nobody takes care of the women — and they take care of me because they do such a great job.” At another point, he suggested he wasn’t familiar with some of the comments in the ad. “I don’t even know some of those statements,” he said. “I mean, I’m hearing these statements. I don’t even know what they are. Nobody respects women more than I do.”
