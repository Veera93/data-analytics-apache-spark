 A “super PAC” supporting Jeb Bush is set to begin airing a new commercial that echoes his recent turn toward a more forceful anti-Washington message.  “We need to disrupt the old order in Washington, D.C.,” Mr. Bush says in the ad, as an image of President Obama and Hillary Rodham Clinton together flashes on the screen. Mr. Bush, trying to find traction as political outsiders perform well in the presidential race, has begun incorporating variations of the word “disrupt” into his remarks, vowing to take on the capital’s political culture the same way he did in Tallahassee as governor of Florida. The 30-second spot by the super PAC, Right to Rise, will air in New Hampshire, with a variation of it running in Iowa.  It is part of the $37 million ad buy the group has placed in the early nominating states through February.
