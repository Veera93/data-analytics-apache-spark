 Lawrence Lessig, the Harvard professor who has raised $1 million for a single-issue presidential campaign, has placed his first television ad, in which he takes aim not at his better-known Democratic primary rivals but at Senator Marco Rubio of Florida, a leading Republican contender. Ignoring both Hillary Rodham Clinton and Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, Mr. Lessig’s 15-second commercial provocatively asks, “Who owns Marco Rubio?” and plasters an image of Mr. Rubio with the logos of big corporations like Blackstone, Goldman Sachs and Wells Fargo that have contributed to his campaign. “This is what our political system has turned into,” warns a woman’s voice. Mr. Rubio’s campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Mr. Lessig, who as an advocate for a free and open Internet, has amassed a following in Silicon Valley, has promised to push through a series of major changes to the political system if he is elected – overhauling campaign finance and ending partisan gerrymandering, among others – then resign. In an interview on Wednesday, Mr. Lessig said he was spending more than $150,000 to run the ad in Iowa and New Hampshire beginning this week as part of a push “to rally people around the idea of the corrupting influence of money” in politics.  Up next for criticism, he said: former Gov. Jeb Bush of Florida. Mr. Lessig said he had not gone after Mrs. Clinton or Mr. Sanders because his goal was to highlight the issue he is running on and that he did not want to “confuse it by starting an interparty war.”  The commercial was produced by Bill Hillsman of North Woods Advertising, whose advertising clients have included former Senator Paul Wellstone, Democrat of Minnesota, who died in 2002.
