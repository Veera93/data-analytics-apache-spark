 Updated, 11:26 a.m. | Marc Short, the head of Freedom Partners, a nonprofit group that oversees the donor network of Charles and David Koch, is leaving his post to advise Senator Marco Rubio’s presidential campaign, two people briefed on the move said Tuesday.  The development provides a potentially significant boost to Mr. Rubio, and comes as the political network established by the Kochs has been grappling with how to handle the swift rise of Donald J. Trump, who is leading the fight for the Republican presidential nomination.  News of the move by Mr. Short was reported by Politico and also posted on Twitter by Major Garrett of CBS News. An aide to Mr. Rubio, the Florida senator, and a spokesman for Mr. Short did not respond to emails seeking comment.  Mark Holden, the chairman of the Freedom Partners board, called Mr. Short a “valued leader” who left behind a “strong” team.  The Kochs, and the network of organizations they control, are unlikely to choose sides in the presidential primary, particularly with five candidates still running. But the question of Mr. Trump has vexed the Kochs and their groups for months. Mr. Trump’s campaign manager, Corey Lewandowski, is a former New Hampshire state director for the Koch-allied Americans for Prosperity, and he has hired some former colleagues for the campaign. Still, the Koch groups have denied the Trump campaign access to the data trove they control, and donors at a recent Koch conference were shown a presentation about Mr. Trump and his policy positions.  Scott Reed, the top political strategist for the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, said Mr. Short has been deeply involved in building durable political infrastructure for years, and knows “the mood of the electorate, particularly primary voters.”
