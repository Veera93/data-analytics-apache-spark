 Representative Steve King, the staunchly conservative and proudly plainspoken firebrand from Iowa, was among the handful of Republicans on Wednesday to take issue with Gov. Nikki Haley’s State of the Union response. But while Mr. King, a key supporter of Senator Ted Cruz’s presidential bid, told reporters he doubted the South Carolina governor was a “principled conservative,” he offered praise of a different sort. “I think she’s beautiful,” he said of Ms. Haley, according to an Associated Press reporter, “so I’d be happy if she’s the face of the party.” — Erica Werner (@ericawerner) January 13, 2016  Ms. Haley, the daughter of immigrants from India, seemed to direct much of her speech Tuesday at Donald J. Trump and his caustic language on immigrants, earning her cheers from both parties. “Some people think that you have to be the loudest voice in the room to make a difference,” Ms. Haley said. “That is just not true. Often, the best thing we can do is turn down the volume.” A spokeswoman for Mr. Cruz did not respond to an email seeking the senator’s view of Ms. Haley’s speech.
