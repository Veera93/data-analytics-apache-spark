 Senator Mitch McConnell, the Kentucky Republican and majority leader, has come under considerable criticism from Democrats for his handling of the Supreme Court vacancy. Now, he faces some second-guessing from Trent Lott, the former Republican senator from Mississippi who was once Mr. McConnell’s partner in leadership. In an interview with David Axelrod for “The Axe Files” podcast from CNN and the University of Chicago Institute of Politics, Mr. Lott suggests he would not have taken the path that Mr. McConnell has in promising to not even consider a nominee. “I probably would’ve handled it differently,” Mr. Lott told Mr. Axelrod, the former adviser to President Obama, in an interview made public on Monday. He added, “My attitude, particularly on the Supreme Court, was that elections do have consequences, sometimes bad, and I tried to lean toward being supportive of the president’s nominees, Democrat or Republican.” Mr. Lott, who is supporting Gov. John R. Kasich of Ohio in the Republican presidential primaries, also had some sharp words about Senator Ted Cruz, Mr. Kasich’s competitor from Texas. “He came here intending right away to run for president,” Mr. Lott said. “And he’s not prepared to be president.”
