 Hillary Rodham Clinton, seeking to balance support for new environmental regulations with the effect those rules could have on workers, unveiled a $30 billion plan on Thursday to help coal miners adjust to their changing landscape.  The plan is part of Mrs. Clinton’s broader agenda on clean energy, and the funds would be intended to help workers affected by any closings of coal-fired power plants, a potential result of new Environmental Protection Agency regulations put in place by the Obama administration.  Mrs. Clinton has suggested that she would add to those regulations and has recently come out against projects such as the Keystone XL oil pipeline, which environmentalists strongly oppose.  The plan is Mrs. Clinton’s latest effort to support coal miners, a unionized group, after releasing proposals that could negatively affect them.  Her plan for coal workers and their families would entail job retraining for those who are put out of work and support for public schools in their areas to supplant the tax dollars that would disappear if coal plants are closed.
