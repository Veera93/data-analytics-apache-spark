 Nevada Democrats and the Senate minority leader, Harry Reid, will host all three Democratic presidential candidates at a party dinner on Jan. 6, six weeks before the caucuses in the state that Hillary Clinton won in 2008, organizers of the event said on Sunday.   Nevada will be third in the nominating process to vote, after Iowa and New Hampshire. It has grown in importance for the Democratic coalition, with an emerging Hispanic electorate. Mrs. Clinton’s win in the caucuses there in 2008 gave her a needed bounce after she came in third in the Iowa caucuses, which Senator Barack Obama won.  So far this year, Democrats have focused on the state in earnest, with Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont holding a large rally in Las Vegas last month to try to demonstrate he can grow his base of support beyond white voters. Former Gov. Martin O’Malley of Maryland is the third Democratic candidate expected to join Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Sanders at the dinner. The so-called Battle Born/Battleground First in the West Caucus Countdown Dinner will be the first time in which all three Democrats will be featured at an event in the state.
