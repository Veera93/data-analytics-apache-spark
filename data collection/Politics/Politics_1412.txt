 The Democratic National Committee has revoked the sponsorship of WMUR, New Hampshire’s most influential television station, of the party’s presidential debate next week because of a labor dispute involving the station. Pressure had been mounting on the station’s parent company, Hearst, for some time, as all three Democratic candidates for president pushed for labor negotiations to at least begin before the debate, scheduled for next Saturday, Dec. 19. Otherwise the candidates faced the prospect of having to cross a picket line. “Regrettably, as a result of WMUR’s unwillingness to move forward on scheduling negotiations between the Hearst Corporation and production department employees represented by I.B.E.W. Local 1228 prior to the debate, we will no longer include WMUR as a co-sponsor of the debate, and their talent will not be participating in any way,” read a joint statement by Representative Debbie Wasserman Schultz, the chairwoman of the national committee, and Ray Buckley, the chairman of the New Hampshire Democratic Party. News of the revocation  was first reported by Politico. On Thursday, the campaign of Martin O’Malley, which is not as flush with cash as his rivals, called on all candidates to stop advertising on the station and for the station to not run segments on the Democratic campaign until labor negotiations began. Revoking the sponsorship means WMUR journalists may not participate in questioning the candidates, and no WMUR branding will appear anywhere on the debate stage. The station’s president, Jeff Bartlett, said in a statement that he was disappointed in the decision, but that “nevertheless, we’ll continue to cover the debate, the candidates and campaigns.”
