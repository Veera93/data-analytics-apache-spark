 President Obama will reach one of the first major milestones of his last year in office on Tuesday night when he delivers his seventh and final State of the Union address. Top aides have made it very clear that the speech would not be the usual litany of legislative priorities but would instead be a grander call to arms on the major challenges facing the nation. Part of the reason for that approach is the president’s instinct to hit broad themes; part of it is the reality that there is little chance for Mr. Obama to push many of his favorite initiatives through the Republican-controlled Congress in his remaining months. The president is also expected to present a more optimistic view of the state of the nation than the one being heard on the Republican presidential campaign trail. As is the tradition, the two parties are inviting guests to highlight political points, with Michelle Obama, the first lady, leaving an empty seat in her box in recognition of victims of gun violence, and Speaker Paul D. Ryan inviting two members of an order of Roman Catholic nuns challenging the Affordable Care Act. The speech will no doubt quickly become fodder for the two sides in the presidential primary campaign, and one of the Obama administration’s goals is to help establish the argument for electing a Democratic successor. The speech can become a ritualistic chore, and Mr. Obama will no doubt be gratified to be finished with the annual rite. Each year, analysts proclaim the State of the Union address, known universally in Washington as the S.O.T.U., to be outdated and irrelevant. But it remains one of the big set pieces of American political life and still serves at minimum to define the political boundaries between the parties, particularly in an election year.
