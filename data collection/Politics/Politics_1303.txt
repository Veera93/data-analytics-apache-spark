 The Obama White House knows political glamour when it sees it, and Justin Trudeau, Canada’s new prime minister, certainly fits the bill. So it is not surprising that the White House announced on Monday that President and Mrs. Obama would host the world’s newest political celebrity and his wife, Sophie Grégoire-Trudeau, on March 10 for one of the final state dinners of Mr. Obama’s presidency. The photogenic Canadian couple has drawn intense attention from the news media, and Mr. Obama had a very cordial meeting at the Paris climate conference with the Canadian leader, whom the White House considers to be on the president’s ideological wavelength. Their high-level meetings in March will cover climate, security, energy and economic issues. But it is the dinner that will generate substantial buzz, and the cachet of the Trudeaus will no doubt prompt intense efforts by some to be invited to an event that usually accommodates 200 or so guests split between government types and boldface names. And that raises the interesting question of who should be on the guest list, given the close ties between the entertainment worlds of the two nations and the multitude of celebrities to choose from.  Who wouldn’t want to be seated at a table with Neil Young, William Shatner, Rachel McAdams, Lorne Michaels, Martin Short, Michael J. Fox or Seth Rogen? Should Alex Trebek attend and become an answer on “Jeopardy!”? How about Justin Bieber? Probably not. Will Celine Dion perform? How about Drake, Shania Twain, The Weeknd or Alanis Morissette? The list of possible guests is extensive. Sadly, John Candy isn’t available, but Dan Aykroyd might be. From the political world, the White House could, of course, invite one of the best known Canadian-born figures in today’s headlines — Senator Ted Cruz of Texas.
