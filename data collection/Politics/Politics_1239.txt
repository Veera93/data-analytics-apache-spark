 Representative Steve Israel, Democrat of New York, is leaving the House, but Representative Nancy Pelosi of California, the longtime party leader, appears to be staying. The announced departure of Mr. Israel, one of Ms. Pelosi’s top lieutenants, prompted speculation on Tuesday about her plans for the future. In recent years, there had been suggestions that Ms. Pelosi, 75, might depart at the end of President Obama’s tenure, after helping him enact an agenda and working to protect it from Republicans after they gained the upper hand in Congress. But multiple House Democrats said they saw no signs that Ms. Pelosi was preparing to step aside and that, in fact, they expected quite the opposite. And Mr. Israel, who said he would not seek re-election in order to focus on a second satirical novel, dropped a big hint in that direction by noting that Ms. Pelosi expressed interest in having him continue to advise her on party strategy when he was out of office. “She asked me to consider working with her on national politics after I leave so I will still have that political role,” he said in an interview. Some have theorized that Ms. Pelosi’s reign has stifled the upward mobility of Mr. Israel and other ambitious politicians such as Representative Chris Van Hollen, who is running for the Democratic Senate nomination in Maryland.   Mr. Israel dismissed that idea and said he saw no reason for her to leave. He called Ms. Pelosi one of the most driven and effective politicians ever, as evidenced by her ability to influence policy from the minority, including her impact on the compromise budget deal Congress passed last month. “I can’t think of anyone who has made a parliamentary minority more relevant,” Mr. Israel said.
