 OVERLAND PARK, Kan. — Ted Cruz walked into a joke about Donald J. Trump and a gentleman’s club. It began with typical stump speech fodder, as Mr. Cruz, the Texas senator, suggested that his rival for the Republican presidential nomination had only recently taken an interest in immigration issues. Mr. Cruz told voters here that Mr. Trump had contributed to members of the so-called Gang of Eight, a group of senators who promoted legislation in 2013 that offered legal status to undocumented immigrants.  “In 2013, when the Gang of Eight fight was being fought, where was Donald?” Mr. Cruz asked. “He was funding them. Donald Trump was funding the Gang of Eight.” A woman listened from the wings. “From a strip club!” she shouted, suggesting (a bit imprecisely) the source of Mr. Trump’s wealth.  Mr. Cruz smirked.  “I don’t know,” he said, “if he gave it to them one dollar at a time.”
