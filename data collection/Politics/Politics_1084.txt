 A volunteer for Ben Carson’s campaign died in a car accident near Atlantic, Iowa, on Tuesday, leading Mr. Carson to suspend campaigning for the day. Two other volunteers and a campaign aide were also injured. The campaign on Tuesday night identified the volunteer who was killed as Braden Joplin, 25. — Dr. Ben Carson (@RealBenCarson) January 20, 2016  Earlier in the day, the campaign released a statement on the crash. “A van transporting three campaign volunteers and a Carson campaign employee hit a patch of ice and flipped on its side where it was struck by another vehicle.” Mr. Joplin was taken to Nebraska Medical Center in Omaha, Neb., where he died. Mr. Carson, who was in South Carolina, had spoken to Mr. Joplin’s family, his campaign said in the statement, and to the attending physician.  In a statement later on Tuesday, Mr. Carson said, “I had the privilege of knowing Braden Joplin personally, and am filled with a deep and profound sadness at his passing.” He continued:  “A presidential candidate asks a lot of his or her volunteers, working long hours in the cold, under-appreciated. They are the unsung heroes of the political process. The outpouring of support for Braden and his family from fellow candidates, as well as their staffs and volunteers, demonstrates that life will always transcend politics, and I thank them for their kind words. Please continue to keep Braden’s family and friends in your prayers as they struggle through this difficult time.”
