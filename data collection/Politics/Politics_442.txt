 While the fight over President Obama’s nomination of Judge Merrick B. Garland to the Supreme Court has largely shifted from Washington to congressional districts, Judge Garland is still planning to meet with senators this week. On Tuesday, he will have introductory meetings with Senators Chuck Schumer of New York and Bob Casey of Pennsylvania, both Democrats. On Wednesday, he will meet with Senator Amy Klobuchar, a member of the Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party from Minnesota. When the Senate returns, he is scheduled to meet with Senator Susan Collins, Republican of Maine. The majority leader, Senator Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky, has vowed that the Senate will not consider Judge Garland’s nomination and will instead wait for the next president to nominate someone to fill Justice Antonin Scalia’s seat on the Supreme Court. After he was nominated last week, however, Judge Garland met with the Senate Democratic leader, Harry Reid of Nevada, and Senator Patrick J. Leahy of Vermont, the senior Democrat on the Judiciary Committee, and the judge is meeting with more senators this week in the hope that Republicans will eventually relent, hold hearings and vote on his confirmation.
