 For a while on Thursday, after a deeply volatile week, the dust around Donald J. Trump’s campaign appeared to settle.  Mr. Trump went to Washington for his first meeting with his foreign-policy team, an emerging group of advisers that, he told Fox News, would be announced to a fuller degree on Friday.   He also met with Reince Priebus, the Republican National Committee chairman, in an effort to smooth the rough patches that have emerged between them in recent weeks. The meeting fell on the same day that the committee issued a list of frequently asked questions that explained exactly how the convention rules work.  On Friday, Mr. Trump will head back to Wisconsin, where he faces a difficult battle and a new front-runner, Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, who is leading some recent public opinion polls by a large amount.  The state holds an open primary on Tuesday, and Mr. Cruz and others hoping to stop Mr. Trump have drawn a line in the sand there. The fact that independents can vote in the primary could complicate the path for Mr. Cruz; they have tended to vote for Mr. Trump in greater numbers than they have for other candidates. And Gov. John R. Kasich of Ohio could also attract independents’ votes.  The primary will be the first real test of whether Mr. Trump’s bumpy week — in which he defended his campaign manager over a charge of battery against a reporter, and defended himself over criticism for remarks he made about abortion — has left a mark with voters.
