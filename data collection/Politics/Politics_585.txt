 Even President Donald J. Trump would follow the law.  That was Mr. Trump’s acknowledgement on Friday, when he reversed course on his vow to kill the families of terrorists and to torture terrorism suspects if he is elected president, saying he now recognized that such actions would violate international law.  Mr. Trump has been heavily criticized for his advocacy of such positions by many former intelligence officials, who say it would be illegal for the United States military to carry out an order to kill a terrorist’s family members.  “I feel very, very strongly about the need to attack and kill those terrorists who attack and kill our people,” Mr. Trump said Friday in the statement released by his campaign. “I know people who died on 9/11. I will never forget those events. I will use every legal power that I have to stop these terrorist enemies. I do, however, understand that the United States is bound by laws and treaties and I will not order our military or other officials to violate those laws and will seek their advice on such matters.”  He added: “I will not order a military officer to disobey the law. It is clear that as president I will be bound by laws just like all Americans and I will meet those responsibilities.”  In recent weeks, Mr. Trump’s remarks on national security have drifted into authoritarian territory, including his declaration that “torture works.” At the Republican presidential debate in Detroit on Thursday night, he insisted that military leaders would follow his orders if he told them to kill the relatives of terrorists, as Fox News moderators pressed him about the legality of such a move.  But Mr. Trump typically has not been troubled by a lack of factual basis for his statements, and rarely has he taken back something he’s said — making his statement Friday that much more of a surprise.
