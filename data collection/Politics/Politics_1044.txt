 Residents of New Jersey who have been missing Gov. Chris Christie during his presidential bid now know what it takes to bring him home: the threat of a big snow. The governor scrapped his plans to wait out the coming snowstorm in New Hampshire on Friday and instead was to head back to the Garden State to prepare for a potential worse weather emergency. Mr. Christie’s Democratic rivals in his home state have criticized his absence during his term and accused him of abandoning the state.  The governor, who was largely praised for his handling of Hurricane Sandy in 2012, initially said that his deputies would be able to prepare for the storm and that he would monitor things from the campaign trail. He faced fresh criticism this week but it was unclear whether the backlash or the strength of the winter storm changed his mind on Friday. However, Mr. Christie promised New Hampshire that he would not be gone for long. “I will be back, because I am able to do both things,” Mr. Christie said on Twitter. “The fact is — you are never not the governor.”
