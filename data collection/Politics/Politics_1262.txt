 Ted Cruz is on a six-day, 28-town swing through Iowa. These are the places, faces and culinary selections of 2016’s first proper bus tour. EVENT 2 Time: 1:05 p.m., Jan. 4 Place: Carroll, Iowa (population: 10,103) Site: Charlie’s Steakhouse, an airy space with booths and a rounded bar. Food: Billybob’s beef brisket, hot-to-trot burger, drunken ribeye T-shirt mounted to wall: “Our Meat Can’t Be Beat” Mood: Lunchtime casual. Sound effects: A cowbell, deployed by a supporter after applause lines. Highlight: As Mr. Cruz began his speech, his microphone cut out. “Apparently the Obama N.S.A. has tried to shut us down,” he said to laughs. The technology rebounded briefly, but moments later, as Mr. Cruz recited the Obama-era policies he would reverse, the sound faded again. “Mr. President?” the senator said into the malfunctioning microphone.
