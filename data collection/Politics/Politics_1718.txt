 For the second time in a week, Ben Carson took the lead in a national poll, drawing 29 percent support in an NBC/Wall Street Journal survey released on Monday evening and eclipsing Donald J. Trump, who had 23 percent. It is the highest any Republican candidate has reached in that survey and bolsters a New York Times poll last week that showed Mr. Carson, a retired neurosurgeon, passing Mr. Trump, who had led state and national polls for months.   Mr. Carson “has broad support but we don’t know yet the depth and commitment of that support,” Fred Yang, one of two pollsters who conducted the survey, said in a statement The poll found that Senator Marco Rubio of Florida, who is coming off a strong debate performance last week, was at 11 percent. Senator Ted Cruz of Texas had 10 percent and Jeb Bush 8 percent. The poll also held good news for Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey, whose recent polling put him in danger of not making the cut for the main stage at the next debate on  Nov. 10 in Milwaukee. Mr. Christie’s 3 percent support in the latest poll appeared to give him an average of 2.5 percent in the four most recent national surveys, which meets the debate’s stated requirement for main stage participation. An analysis last week by another pollster, Patrick Murray of Monmouth University, suggested that Mr. Christie could become the first candidate to be demoted from the main debate stage because he was pulling just 1 percent in some surveys. On Monday Mr. Murray said Mr. Christie had moved up to “the magic 2.5” percent average.  Other candidates near the cutoff also cleared the bar: Mike Huckabee, Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky and Gov. John R. Kasich of Ohio.
