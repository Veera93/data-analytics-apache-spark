 DES MOINES — Senator Joni Ernst of Iowa wants you to know that she is remaining neutral in next week’s caucuses.    “I have said I am not going to endorse in this race, and that is a promise I am going to keep to Iowa,” she said on Monday, adding in case there was any lingering ambiguity: “So I’m not endorsing.” Some Iowans might have been forgiven for thinking otherwise. There was Ms. Ernst, the state’s freshman Republican senator, standing on stage here with Senator Marco Rubio of Florida, who is campaigning for president. She spoke glowingly, in a neutral kind of way. Mr. Rubio was “a good friend to me,” someone who is “near and dear to my heart.” But as dear as he is, she said, he would also be a ruthless commander in chief when it comes to fighting the Islamic State. She wants a president “who will just not contain ISIS or degrade ISIS — I want someone who will destroy ISIS.” Mr. Rubio would do that, she said. “I’ve watched him fight that fight.” This nonendorsement was important to Mr. Rubio, who is hoping to finish a strong third in the Iowa caucuses. Lacking some of the high-profile conservative support that rivals like Senator Ted Cruz of Texas have, the Florida senator could see a jolt from the wink and nod Ms. Ernst has given him. The two share more than just seats in the Senate. Mr. Rubio endorsed Ms. Ernst when she was in the midst of a primary fight in 2014. And the consultants who helped her win are also now instrumental in Mr. Rubio’s presidential campaign. Ms. Ernst’s appearance with Mr. Rubio may not have been an official endorsement. But she is not planning to appear with any of his competitors for the Republican nomination. Asked whether she would be extending similar courtesies to anyone else, an Ernst spokeswoman responded neutrally.  “Currently there’s none scheduled, but we’re happy to do our best to accommodate any requests that the schedule allows,” the spokeswoman said.
