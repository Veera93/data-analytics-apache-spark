 Hillary Clinton pulled out a tight victory over Senator Bernie Sanders in the Democratic primary in Missouri, officially sweeping the states that held primary contests on March 15, while Donald J. Trump was declared the winner in a close race with Senator Ted Cruz on the Republican side.  Both candidates appeared to score narrow victories in Missouri, but under the state’s elections laws, the vote totals were not official until now. The slim victory for Mrs. Clinton — 49.6 percent to 49.4 percent — is a capstone for what was a successful day. It also was something of a moral one for the former secretary of state, who lost there in 2008 to Senator Barack Obama. Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Sanders are each expected to receive 34 delegates from the state. Mr. Trump won the state by a margin of 40.9 percent to 40.7 percent for Mr. Ted Cruz. Gov. John Kasich won 9.9 percent of the vote. Mr. Trump is expected to receive 25 delegates from Missouri, while Mr. Cruz gets 15.
