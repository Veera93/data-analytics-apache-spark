 Let’s just say Donald J. Trump is not blaming Canada this time. After Lena Dunham, the star and creator of the HBO show “Girls,” said Monday that she would move to Canada if Mr. Trump wins the White House, the New York businessman all but offered to escort her there personally on his private plane.  “Now I have to get elected because I’ll be doing a great service to our country,” Mr. Trump said during a phone interview with “Fox &amp; Friends” on Tuesday. “Now it’s much more important. In fact, I’ll immediately get off this call and start campaigning right now.” He called Ms. Dunham, who is supporting Hillary Clinton for president, “a B actor” who “has no mojo,” and criticized Whoopi Goldberg, who is among a number of celebrity Trump antagonists who have made similar vows.  “I heard Whoopi Goldberg said that, too – that would be a great, great thing for our country if she got out,” he said. Mr. Trump also used the interview to rebut reports that he and his newly installed campaign chief, Paul Manafort, have clashed over just how “presidential” Mr. Trump needs to act. Mr. Manafort told party officials at a meeting in Florida last week that Mr. Trump was simply playing a part and would be “evolving” into a more serious general election candidate — something Mr. Trump promptly refuted over the weekend, when he told his crowds he had no intent of “toning it down.” The candidate told “Fox &amp; Friends” that Mr. Manafort has been very pleased with his recent performance. “I know he’s very happy,” Mr. Trump said. “Yesterday I had two full stadiums in Pennsylvania, and in Rhode Island it was unbelievable — it was like a love fest. It’s always like a love fest.”
