 Supporters of Ben Carson, with his strength in the polls showing signs of fading, lashed out at critics and the national media in a fund-raising plea on Monday that they hope will reinvigorate his campaign. “Ben Carson has been completely under siege from the dishonest national mainstream media these last few weeks,” John Philip Sousa IV, chairman of the 2016 Committee, a “super PAC” that backs the Republican presidential candidate, wrote in an email to supporters. “The vulgar, personal attacks are some of the most vicious I’ve ever seen in politics.” Mr. Carson, a retired neurosurgeon, was riding a wave of popularity just a month ago as voters in Iowa and across the country were captivated by his soft-spoken, conservative message. But greater scrutiny of his biography and his knowledge of foreign policy has eaten away at his support as national security has become a dominant issue. This month, Mr. Carson’s backers, who helped draft him into the race, hired a new media team to showcase a different side of the doctor through interviews with his former patients. On Monday, the group accused critics of Mr. Carson of peddling rumors that he was suspending his campaign to go on a book tour and warned that rivals such as former Gov. Jeb Bush of Florida, Gov. John Kasich of Ohio and Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey were pouring millions of dollars into television ads. “All of the grass-roots energy is on our side but we lack the million-dollar checks that flow in to establishment candidates via their super PACs,” Mr. Sousa wrote, asking supporters to sign up to give a monthly “gift” to the group so that they could continue to defend Mr. Carson. A Fox News poll over the weekend showed Mr. Carson’s support among Republicans nationally falling to 18 percent from 23 percent, leaving him well behind Donald J. Trump, with Senator Marco Rubio of Florida and Senator Ted Cruz of Texas quickly gaining ground.
