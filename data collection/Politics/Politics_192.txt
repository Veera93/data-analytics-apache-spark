 With the Democratic nominating contest entering its final stretch and her sights set on the general election, Hillary Clinton raised roughly $26.4 million in April for her primary fight, her campaign said Monday, taking in more than her rival, Bernie Sanders, during the month. Mrs. Clinton, who now has $30 million on hand in her campaign, also raised an additional $9.5 million for Democratic candidates and state parties nationwide through a joint fund-raising program with the Democratic National Committee. That program allows for some of that money to also be used for Mrs. Clinton’s campaign. “Thanks to 1.2 million people across the country, we have the resources we need to continue to run a winning primary campaign while preparing for the general election,” said Robby Mook, Mrs. Clinton’s campaign manager. The fund-raising  brings the total Mrs. Clinton has raised in primary funds to $213.5 million, compared to $210 million for Mr.  Sanders. But Mrs. Clinton’s impressive total has been met with scrutiny for her reliance on high-dollar events with Wall Street executives while Mr. Sanders has largely raised his money online through small-dollar donations. Yet, Mr. Sanders’s juggernaut has slowed down amid his narrowing path to the nomination. In April, he raised $25.8 million, about $20 million less than in March, when Mr. Sanders defeated Mrs. Clinton in a string of contests. Mrs. Clinton has also decreased spending on television ads in the primaries as her campaign gears up for the general election, while Mr. Sanders has been forced to lay off staff to invest heavily in hopes of winning Indiana on Tuesday and delegate-rich California in June.
