 With Republican Senator Ted Cruz, the leader in Iowa polls, spending the week effectively off the campaign trail, his rivals seemed to sense an opening: zigzag the state, press the flesh and make an early impression before the field descends on Iowa after New Year’s. On Monday, though, some candidates’ best plans were upended by an opponent that could outpace even Donald J. Trump in bluster: the weather. With several inches of snow, and icy conditions and howling winds expected in some parts of the state, Senator Marco Rubio of Florida and Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey were forced to cancel events. — Marco Rubio (@marcorubio) December 28, 2015  Events on Tuesday and Wednesday were expected to go on as planned, so far. Mr. Christie was also forced to adjust his schedule on Monday, but hoped to salvage at least some of it. — Chris Christie (@ChrisChristie) December 28, 2015  But hours later, Mr. Christie campaign said the Davenport event could not go on, either. A recent Iowa poll from The Des Moines Register and Bloomberg Politics placed Mr. Cruz, a Texas senator, in first place, with the support of 31 percent of likely Republican caucusgoers. Mr. Trump was second with 21 percent. As he has risen in the polls, both in Iowa and nationally, Mr. Cruz has attracted more intense criticism from his rivals and their allies, most notably tussling over immigration and national security policies with Mr. Rubio. Mr. Trump has generally resisted direct hits on Mr. Cruz, at least by his standards.
