 It’s another primary day, with nominating contests from Mississippi to Hawaii. For the Democrats, it’s another opportunity for Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont to forge a path forward against Hillary Clinton. For the Republicans, it’s another chance to try to blunt the front-runner, Donald J. Trump, or a chance for the New York real-estate developer to further lock up delegates.  In Michigan and Mississippi, both parties will hold primaries. Republicans will also hold caucuses in Hawaii and a primary in Idaho. Michigan is a rich opportunity for Mr. Sanders: It’s a state where his populist message could resonate. Mrs. Clinton now leads Mr. Sanders in pledged delegates, and the map does not favor him going forward.  On the Republican side, the contest, as it has been for weeks, is more fluid. If Mr. Trump wins Michigan, it will provide him a push after a tough outing last weekend on so-called Super Saturday. But Senator Ted Cruz of Texas is trying hard to keep it close or win outright, and Gov. John R. Kasich of Ohio hopes to do well. For Senator Marco Rubio of Florida, another weak showing could be problematic.  If Republicans deny Mr. Trump a win, it will bolster their efforts to keep him from locking up the 1,237 delegates needed to win the nomination. But Mr. Cruz has struggled with evangelical voters in the campaign since Iowa, despite being the candidate with the clearest argument to the right of Mr. Trump. If Mr. Cruz does not rise in Mississippi, his inability to consolidate social conservatives will be a factor.
