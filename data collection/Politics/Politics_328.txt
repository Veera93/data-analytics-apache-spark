 Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, said on Thursday that he would sit down with President Obama’s Supreme Court nominee, reversing course after saying that he would not meet with him. Mr. Graham, a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, will meet with the nominee, Judge Merrick B. Garland, out of “courtesy,” said Kevin Bishop, the senator’s spokesman. But Mr. Bishop said Mr. Graham was still against the nomination. “Graham remains opposed to moving forward with the Garland nomination,” Mr. Bishop said in an email. “He continues to believe the next president should pick the next nominee for the Supreme Court.” Mr. Graham’s decision, first reported by CNN, is striking as Senate Republicans work to shore up their ranks and counter White House officials’ suggestion that some Republicans find fault with their leaders’ firm opposition to considering Judge Garland’s nomination. Last week two Republican senators reversed their initial support for holding hearings on Mr. Obama’s pick, after facing pressure from conservative groups. In explaining Mr. Graham’s apparent change of heart, Mr. Bishop pointed to a remark last month by Senator Charles E. Grassley, Republican of Iowa and the committee’s chairman, on his own decision to meet with Judge Garland. “If I can meet with a dictator in Uganda, I can surely meet with a decent person in America,” Mr. Grassley said at the time. Mr. Grassley will have breakfast with Judge Garland on Tuesday, where he planned to explain why the committee has vowed not to hold hearings. Mr. Bishop said no meeting had been scheduled between Mr. Graham and Judge Garland. Mr. Graham is one of 18 Republican senators who have said they are open to meeting with the judge;  three have already done so. Judge Garland met with four more Democratic senators on Thursday, including the two remaining Democrats on the committee he had yet to see: Senators Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut and Chris Coons of Delaware.
