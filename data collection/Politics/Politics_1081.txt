 Advocates of pending criminal justice legislation are intensifying their push to persuade congressional leaders to move forward on measures awaiting House and Senate action. In a new letter to the four top party leaders, more than 70 current and former police chiefs and sheriffs joined federal and state prosecutors in urging Congress to act. “Our experience has shown us that the country can reduce crime while also reducing unnecessary arrests, prosecutions and incarceration,” said the letter from Law Enforcement Leaders to Reduce Crime and Incarceration, one of the advocacy groups behind the effort to cut mandatory minimum sentences. Among the signers were Thomas Dart, the sheriff of Cook County, Ill.; Robert B. Fiske Jr., former United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York; B. Todd Jones, former director of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives; Chief Charles A. McClelland Jr. of the Houston police; Chief Kathleen O’Toole of the Seattle Police Department; Richard L. Thornburgh, the former attorney general; and Chief Robert C. White of the Denver Police. Members of the diverse left-right coalition supporting changes to criminal justice have said that to be successful they need to establish momentum early in the legislative year. Given that view, the lobbying effort is expected to become more pronounced in the coming days.
