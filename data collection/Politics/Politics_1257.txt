 Ted Cruz is on a six-day, 28-town swing through Iowa. These are the places, faces and culinary selections of 2016’s first proper bus tour. EVENT 4 Time: 6:42 p.m., Jan. 4. Place: Winterset, Iowa (population: 5,190) Site: Winterset Stage, a local theater with impeccable acoustics and an open mike night on Jan. 30 (top prize: $50) Mood: spirited high school assembly Music: Banjo, violin and guitar ensemble to warm up the crowd before Mr. Cruz began. One act included a Cruz-focused anthem whose chorus is the name of his book, “A Time for Truth.” Lyrics: “I’m swayed by every policy / Knowing what he believes / It’s standing strong for this country / It’s a tiii-iiime for truth.” Cultural references: Renee Zellweger’s character from Jerry Maguire (“You had me at hello”) and John F. Kennedy (“I intend to have in the office of president what J.F.K. used to refer to as ‘vigaaaahhh’ in defending the Constitution.” ) Highlight: As Mr. Cruz lamented the spending habits of the federal government, something dripped upon the stage from on high. “The budget is so bad that the pipes are leaking,” he said dryly.
