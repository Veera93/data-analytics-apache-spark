 Senator Ted Cruz, who is scrambling to come up with ways to fend off sustained attacks from Donald J. Trump on his policies and personality, has been digging around in the archives of Mr. Trump’s Twitter feed. On Thursday, the Republican from Texas surfaced a Twitter post that Mr. Trump wrote in 2013 in which he said that “amnesty should be done only if the border is secure.” As a presidential candidate, Mr. Trump has taken a hard line against amnesty, vowing to build a wall along the border with Mexico and deport anyone who is in the country illegally. But Mr. Cruz is calling him a flip-flopper on immigration. — Ted Cruz (@tedcruz) January 21, 2016  Mr. Cruz has done away with his nonaggression strategy against Mr. Trump and has adjusted his stump speech to argue that voters should pick a candidate who will not “burn” them by promising things that clash with their previous actions. Mr. Trump does not shy away from his liberal views from the past, comparing himself to former President Ronald Reagan, who converted to conservatism later in life. As for Mr. Cruz, Mr. Trump is holding firm in his contention that the Canadian-born senator might not even be eligible for the presidency and would not be able to get anything done in Washington. “Nobody likes him,” Mr. Trump said this week.
