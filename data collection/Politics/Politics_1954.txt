 Senator Ted Cruz of Texas got an early start to the 2016 presidential campaign in March by being the first of what would become a vast field to announce his candidacy. Now, he has turned that starting advantage into a sprawling ground game. For every county in the first four voting states of Iowa, New Hampshire, South Carolina and Nevada, the Cruz campaign has locked down county chairs in charge of not just lending their names to the campaign, but of spearheading outreach and organizing efforts. “The only way we will turn our country around is through a grass-roots uprising of the American people, and I’m grateful for the many courageous conservatives in the early states who have stepped forward to lead that grass-roots movement,” Mr. Cruz said in a statement on Tuesday. The focus on the ground game should come as no surprise, as the Cruz campaign has been heavily focused on building leadership teams, including in the United States Virgin Islands, and even sending operatives as far as Guam and Samoa to look for potential support. It has also focused on building issue-based teams in the early states, such as their “99 Iowa Pastors” initiative, which seeks to tap into the networks to build more grass-roots support. The large list of county chairs further emphasized the conservative grass-roots support that has followed Mr. Cruz since his announcement, with small-dollar fund-raisers powering his $10 million haul in the second quarter. The campaign has not released their numbers for the latest quarter, however.
