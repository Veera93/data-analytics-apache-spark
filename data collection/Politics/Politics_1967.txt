 Speaker John A. Boehner announced Monday that the entire House would select his replacement on Oct. 29 and that all other openings in the House Republican leadership would be filled subsequent to that vote. The new schedule is a pronounced shift from plans to choose a Republican candidate for speaker and possibly a new majority leader and party whip on Thursday when Republicans are to gather to pick their choice for Mr. Boehner’s successor. Some conservatives have been clamoring for more time so they could identify other candidates. “This new process will ensure House Republicans have a strong, unified team to lead our conference and focus on the American people’s priorities,” Mr. Boehner said in a statement. While House Republicans are to pick their candidate for speaker by majority vote, that candidate will still have to secure a majority, or 218 votes, on the floor to win the position.
