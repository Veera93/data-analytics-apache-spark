 Gov. Rick Scott of Florida, a Republican who won a 2010 primary as an insurgent businessman running against a veteran politician, said on Thursday that he would not make an endorsement before the presidential primary in his state on March 15. The statement came amid speculation that Mr. Scott might endorse Donald J. Trump, another insurgent outsider who owns property in Florida. Mr. Scott recently praised Mr. Trump in a newspaper opinion piece. “I have made it my practice to not get involved in primaries because picking the Republican candidate is the voters’ job,” Mr. Scott wrote in a Facebook post. “The political class opposed me when I first ran for office, they did not want a businessman outsider, but the voters had other ideas,” he wrote. “I trust the voters, so I will not try to tell the Republican voters in Florida how to vote by endorsing a candidate before our primary on March 15.  I believed in the voters when I first ran for office, and I still believe in them today.” He added, “I continue to believe that economic growth and job creation is the most crucial issue for the next president to tackle.” Senator Marco Rubio of Florida is hoping to win the primary in his home state. But polls there show Mr. Trump ahead, and a loss would be a severe blow to Mr. Rubio’s candidacy.
