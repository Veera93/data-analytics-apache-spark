 Paul D. Ryan, the speaker of the House, has a nifty camera set up on his Capitol Hill balcony, which is used to live-stream all of his events. So it was decided that last weekend’s snowstorm would be streamed, too.  Does watching snow fall sound boring? Apparently not  — the footage attracted more than half a million Americans from all 50 states and the District of Columbia, where the snow totals were measured at close to 30 inches. The average viewer checked out the scene for nearly the entire three-minute looping,  with the music, “Gold Skies,” playing in the background. The snowcam made for one of the highest traffic moments of Mr. Ryan’s speakership so far, rivaling the Instagram musings about his beard. So do Americans love Mr. Ryan, or just snow? Who knows, but Entertainment Weekly gave the whole deal a B+.
