 
Never one to hold back, Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, the Democratic leader and bane of the Koch brothers and Mitt Romney, made clear on Thursday that he intended to spend much of the rest of the year savaging Donald J. Trump. In a conference call with reporters from his home in Las Vegas, Mr. Reid lit into Mr. Trump, calling him anti-woman, anti-Hispanic, anti-Muslim, anti-immigrant, anti-President Obama and anti-working people, to name a few. “It is a sad day for Republicans when they decide to bow to Trump,” said Mr. Reid, who is not running for re-election, potentially freeing him up to be even more aggressive than usual.  But even in his anti-Trump diatribe, Mr. Reid found a moment to express regret at the passing of a musical superstar as he discussed opioid abuse and attempts to combat it. “I don’t want to jump the gun, but it appears that even the great Prince was involved with opioid abuse,” Mr. Reid said. “And that’s such a shame.”
