 SALEM, N.H. – Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina showed his dual roles on the campaign trail Sunday morning: part Jeb Bush surrogate, part warm-up comedian. Mr. Graham took the microphone at a rally for Mr. Bush here, delivering line after line and receiving more laughter than applause. Mr. Bush, still chuckling as he took the microphone from Mr. Graham, noted that “he’s got a career after politics.” Some of Mr. Graham’s more well-received lines: On middle school: “It was the best eight years of my life.” On South Carolina: “Come back, spend money.” On Saturday night’s debate: “Do y’all wanna hear what I thought about the debate? If you don’t, you better leave.” On Gov. Chris Christie: “I never want to make Chris Christie mad.” On Ben Carson and Senator Ted Cruz: “I never believed anybody could make Ben Carson mad. That says a lot about Ted Cruz. There’s like 40 people running for president. Isn’t it odd that only Ted thought Ben was getting out?” On Donald J. Trump: “What did I learn? That if you’re a senior citizen and you own a house in Atlantic City, Donald is not your friend.” On Senator Marco Rubio: “I learned that Marco has a good memory because he kept saying the same thing over and over again.” And finally, on himself and his failed presidential bid: “I got out because I ran out of money. If you want to get money out of politics, you should have joined my campaign.”
