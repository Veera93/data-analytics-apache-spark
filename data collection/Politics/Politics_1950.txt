 Senator Bernie Sanders has scored his first endorsement from a member of Congress, getting it just ahead of next week’s first Democratic debate.  The backing of Representative Raúl M. Grijalva of Arizona is especially significant as he is a longstanding member of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, offering the independent from Vermont a valuable spokesman as he seeks to court Hispanic voters. They will campaign together in Tuscon, Ariz., at a rally ahead of the debate in Las Vegas next Tuesday. “I couldn’t sit on the sidelines and wait for the tea leaves to be read better,” Mr. Grijalva said in an interview. “The positions he has taken and the values he holds are ones I share.” Mr. Grijalva said he has known Mr. Sanders for 14 years and that he agrees with him on income inequality, trade, education and the environment. Avoiding being critical of Hillary Rodham Clinton, Mr. Sanders’s chief rival for the Democratic nomination, Mr. Grijalva said that the Vermont senator’s consistency on such issues is the main reason he is offering his support.  Mr. Grijalva said he realizes that Mr. Sanders faces a tough battle considering the campaign infrastructure that Mrs. Clinton has established, but added that he hopes to provide outreach to different types of voters. While Mr. Sanders has attracted large crowds and enthusiastic support, the bulk of it has come from white, progressive voters.  “Latino sectors of the country, African-Americans, people of color — they’re feeling the economic pain as much as anyone else,” said Mr. Grijalva, who is Mexican-American. “Bernie has good positions on immigration and education, which are fountain issues for the Latino community. There’s an opportunity to talk about those and expose the fact that Bernie is not just a one-tune candidate, which he’s not.” The Los Angeles Times reported Mr. Grijalva’s endorsement.
