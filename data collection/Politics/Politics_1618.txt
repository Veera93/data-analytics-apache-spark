 Jim Webb may have abandoned his bid for the Democratic presidential nomination, but the former senator from Virginia is not finished criticizing Hillary Rodham Clinton. Mr. Webb, a former combat Marine, accused Mrs. Clinton of “disparaging” the United States Marine Corps when she said that she was turned away when she wanted to serve in 1975. Last week, Republicans mocked Mrs. Clinton after she told voters in New Hampshire about her flirtation with military service and recalled that the Marines rebuffed her as too old when she inquired about enlisting at age 26. “She should tell us when and where this meeting took place, and with whom,” Mr. Webb wrote in a Facebook post on Monday.  window.fbAsyncInit = function() {

  }(document, 'script', 'facebook-jssdk')); The criticism is striking coming from a Democrat and a decorated veteran.  But Mr. Webb has been disillusioned with his party lately. In October he suspended his campaign and said he was considering making a bid for the White House as an independent.
