 As the New York presidential primaries on April 19 draw nearer, groups of business leaders are joining together in an effort to help people vote by highlighting a state law that requires employers to give their workers two hours of paid leave to head to the polls. The Association for a Better New York, the Partnership for New York City and other organizations are starting a campaign called Promote the Vote, which will include a website offering information about state voting rates. The civic groups involved in the campaign are encouraging employers to sign up for the effort, which is nonpartisan. William C. Rudin, the chairman of the Association for a Better New York, said the state’s voter participation rate had been among the lowest in the nation in recent elections. “Obviously, we’re seeing across the country and in these primaries a tremendous surge of voter participation” elsewhere, Mr. Rudin said. The goal of reminding people that they are entitled to paid leave to vote could “reduce some of the impediments and excuses that people have for not voting,” he added. Kathryn S. Wylde, the president of the Partnership for New York City, said that members of her group represented well over one million jobs. She said the goal of the campaign was to try to keep people involved in the political process.
