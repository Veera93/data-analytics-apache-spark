 A new 60-second radio ad by Ben Carson’s campaign will begin airing Friday in eight markets — including Atlanta, Detroit and Miami. The Carson campaign is putting $150,000 behind the ad, titled “Freedom,” which takes the form of a rap song and is aimed at African-American voters. The ad splices the calm voice of Mr. Carson, a retired pediatric neurosurgeon, with that of the artist Aspiring Mogul over a thumping club beat, with lyrics like, “vote and support Ben Carson, for our next president, it’d be awesome.”   “If we want to get America back on track, we gotta vote Ben Carson as a matter of fact,” the rap concludes. The release of the ad comes as Mr. Carson seeks to draw black voters to his candidacy and broaden the Republican Party’s appeal among minorities.
