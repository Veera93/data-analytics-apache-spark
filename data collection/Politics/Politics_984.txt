 Hillary Clinton and Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont remain deadlocked in Iowa less than a week before the caucuses, according to a new poll that shows the first nominating contest going down to the wire.  A survey from Quinnipiac University found that 49 percent of likely Democratic caucusgoers supported Mr. Sanders and that 45 percent backed Mrs. Clinton. The poll had a margin of error of plus or minus four percentage points. Mr. Sanders held a similar lead in a Quinnipiac poll this month, and other groups have projected mixed outcomes, leaving the race in Iowa muddled before the caucuses there on Monday. Wednesday’s results show that Mr. Sanders remains the favorite of voters who consider themselves to be more liberal, of younger people and of voters who are most concerned about the economy. Mrs. Clinton does best with women, older voters and those who care most about health care. “It must make her think of eight years ago, when her failure in Iowa cost her the presidency,” said Peter A. Brown, assistant director of Quinnipiac’s poll. In 2008, Mrs. Clinton faced a surprising loss in the state to Barack Obama, then an Illinois senator, jumpstarting his presidential bid. Mr. Sanders holds a commanding lead in several New Hampshire polls. Trailing the two leading candidates in Iowa is Martin O’Malley, the former Maryland governor, with 4 percent support. With the race so close, Mr. O’Malley’s backers could sway the outcome on caucus night.
