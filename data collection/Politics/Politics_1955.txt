 The Hurricane Joaquin floodwater plaguing South Carolina could prove difficult to navigate for some of the Republican presidential candidates, in particular Senator Lindsey Graham, the sitting senator from the state. “Let’s just get through this thing, and whatever it costs, it costs,” Mr. Graham told CNN’s Wolf Blitzer on “The Situation Room,” in a plea for federal aid. As Mr. Blitzer pointed out, Mr. Graham voted against a large relief package for New York and New Jersey after Hurricane Sandy. He said he did not remember voting that way and was “all for helping the people in New Jersey,” but he later clarified his thoughts to The Washington Post, saying that package was a “pork-fest” and that he would “fight like a tiger to make sure somebody doesn’t use our tragedy for their advantage.” But as South Carolina will require aid from around the country to rebuild after the flooding that has killed at least 11 people and left roughly 40,000 without water, it may test the Republican candidates flocking to the state as part of its early primary process: come out in favor of federal aid, or stick to fiscally conservative principles. Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, who also voted against the Hurricane Sandy aid bill, called for federal relief in his state after flooding in May. One candidate who most likely will not worry about requesting aid: Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey, who accused Congress of “callous indifference” during the debate over aid after Hurricane Sandy.
