 DUBUQUE, Iowa — Donald J. Trump’s golden-lettered plane is one of the biggest toys in national politics. And he used it as such on Saturday, to keep children happy after waiting more than an hour in a chilly airport hangar for his first of three rallies today.  At the outset at the rally, Mr. Trump said he would let small children “run through the plane” as he talked. Not the parents, though, he said quickly. “Because the parents will damage it,” he added.  Mr. Trump’s plane swept low past the crowd as the theme from the movie “Air Force One” blared, prompting “ooohs!” from the crowd. He used a similar trick in Arizona months ago.  The rally did not fill the area created for attendees, although hundreds were on hand.
