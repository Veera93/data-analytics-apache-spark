 After months of long-distance jousting over the Iran nuclear deal, President Obama and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel will meet on Monday for the first time in more than a year and try to put their feuding behind them. Mr. Obama will host Mr. Netanyahu in the Oval Office at 10:30 a.m., and both will make statements to reporters before the meeting. After journalists are ushered out, the two plan to talk about enforcement of the Iran deal, other Iranian aggression in the region, the war in Syria and the latest spasm of violence between Israelis and Palestinians, White House aides said. As part of the attempt to repair their breach, Mr. Obama will repeat his offers of more security aid, and the two will discuss a new long-term security agreement. “Both Prime Minister Netanyahu and President Obama are clearly focused” on “looking forward,” said Dan Shapiro, the American ambassador to Israel. “And in so doing, there’s a focus on a lot of areas of common interest and convergence.” But there will also be a good deal of attention paid to body language. And the White House will be observing what Mr. Netanyahu says later in the day when he attends a dinner in his honor at the conservative American Enterprise Institute. As part of his effort to smooth over what became a partisan schism, Mr. Netanyahu on Tuesday will address the liberal Center for American Progress, where he may not receive as warm a reception but will try to emphasize his appreciation of American support across the aisle.
