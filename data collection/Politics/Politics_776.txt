 The most prominent “super PAC” supporting Ted Cruz said on Monday that it was placing a $573,000 ad buy in Nevada and boosting its field operations in the state. The move by the group, Keep the Promise I, comes a week before the Nevada caucuses on the Republican side — a key test for Mr. Cruz and his allies, who are hoping to capitalize on Donald J. Trump’s perceived weakness in ground organization. A spokeswoman said the group had 13 paid staff members and about 75 canvassers in the state. While Mr. Trump has significant holdings and impeccable name recognition in Nevada, his loss in Iowa, another caucus state, has left questions about his capacity to efficiently turn out voters in states where organization matters more than advertising.  Mr. Cruz’s campaign and super PAC network have invested heavily on the ground in states across the primary calendar. Keep the Promise I said it was hiring Nathan Emens, a local operative, to oversee its Nevada ground game. The group also plans to distribute 100,000 mail pieces in the state this week highlighting Marco Rubio’s “less than conservative record on immigration, cap-and-trade, military spending and Libya.” “You are only as good as the company you keep…” the mailer reads, with Mr. Rubio, a senator from Florida, pictured beside images of Hillary Clinton and Senators Chuck Schumer of New York and Harry Reid of Nevada. The two television spots in the ad buy are mostly positive, focusing on Mr. Cruz, though one does feature an ominous photo of Mr. Rubio as Mr. Cruz is heard saying, “Who actually has stood up not just to Democrats but to leaders in our own party?”
