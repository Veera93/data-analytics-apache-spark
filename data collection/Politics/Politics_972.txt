 Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont has said that he plans to release his medical records before the Iowa caucuses on Monday. But with just five days to go, his campaign is not saying when exactly those records will be made public. Mr. Sanders first said several weeks ago that he would release the records. Then he told CNN’s Chris Cuomo during a town-hall-style meeting on Monday that he planned to make the records public before caucus day, which will be the first test of whether he can beat Hillary Clinton and go on to win the Democratic presidential nomination. “I have been blessed with good health and good endurance,” Mr. Sanders told Mr. Cuomo. “And there’s nothing in the medical records that is going to surprise anybody. And we will get them out as soon as possible.” He also looked to his wife as he assured Mr. Cuomo that he would release the records.  “Absolutely. They’re sitting — where are they, Jane? They’re on our table right now? All right. We will release them,” Mr. Sanders said. Symone Sanders, a spokeswoman for the Sanders campaign, reiterated in an interview Wednesday that the records would be released “soon” and that the campaign still had time before the Iowa caucuses. “The senator has said that he will release his health records before Feb. 1, and it is not yet Feb. 1,” Ms. Sanders said. “So we are not hiding anything. He is in great health and he has said that. So, there’s nothing to hide here. We will get the health records out soon.”
