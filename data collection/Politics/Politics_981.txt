 In the most recent ad from the Sanders campaign, sandwiched between scenes of Iowans going about their daily lives, is a quick clip of a small child crushing a pitch tossed underhand by Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont.  With a high arc, the ball soars over the senator as he spins to watch it fly outfield. Mr. Sanders’s voice tracking the ad mentions “grandchildren.”  The potential future baseball star is indeed Mr. Sanders’s grandson, Dylan, a 4½-year-old fan of the Vermont Lake Monsters. Mr. Sanders has been playing baseball with Dylan for “a couple years,” according to a spokesman, getting Dylan started early with a bat in hand. And it’s not just baseball: Dylan also decided the other night that he would run for president, telling his grandfather, “You give me the words to say.”  Mr. Sanders was a basketball player and a long-distance runner.  “I was a very good athlete,” Mr. Sanders said on Monday during CNN’s town-hall-style forum in Des Moines. “I wouldn’t say I was a great athlete.” His grandson, on the other hand, may surpass him.
