 Donald J. Trump is moving forward with his Thursday night campaign event, which will serve as counter-programming for the Republican presidential debate that he has decided to skip. The Trump campaign announced on Wednesday that Mr. Trump will hold a “Special Event to Benefit Veterans Organizations” at Drake University’s Sheslow Auditorium in Des Moines at 8 p.m. — just as the debate is scheduled to begin elsewhere in Des Moines. Mr. Trump abruptly pulled out of the Fox News debate on Tuesday evening after his feud with Megyn Kelly, one of the moderators, boiled over into a war of words with the cable network.  The campaign said it would provide additional details about the rally.  Mr. Trump took to Twitter on Wednesday to explain his decision, claiming that he was opting out of the debate more because of a taunting statement by Fox News’s public relations team than his feelings about Ms. Kelly. — Donald J.
