 Ted Cruz is on a six-day, 28-town swing through Iowa. These are the places, faces and culinary selections of 2016’s first proper bus tour. EVENT 16 Time: 4:29 p.m., Jan. 7 Place: Webster City, Iowa (population: 8,070) Site: A modest airplane hangar, with a small propeller plane that some used as a coat rack. Mood: pleasantly awaiting takeoff Cruelest protester sign: “Ted Cruz Likes Nickelback” Stephen Sondheim echo: “A funny thing happened on the way to the forum,” Mr. Cruz told reporters, describing the state of the Republican race. Highlight: Mr. Cruz does not let a stump speech pass without the locust joke. Years back, he said, he was in West Texas discussing the differences between regulators and locusts. “The thing is,” he said, “you can’t use pesticide on the regulators.” An old farmer leaned back, Mr. Cruz recalled, and accepted the challenge: “Wanna bet?” the man said, according to Mr. Cruz’s thick drawl. The crowd chuckled reliably.
