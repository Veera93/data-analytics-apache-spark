 He’s been known to drift into a drawl when quoting Ronald Reagan on the campaign trail and once jokingly auditioned for “The Simpsons.” But Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, who once aspired to be an actor, saves his best impressions for his favorite movie, “The Princess Bride.”  In an interview while taping a “Candidate Cafe” segment for radio station WMUR in New Hampshire, Mr. Cruz acted out an entire scene from the movie.  He did his impressions of both Billy Crystal and Carol Kane, as well as the often impersonated character Inigo Montoya (portrayed in the 1987 film by Mandy Patinkin), while acting out a scene in which he switched from character to character without missing a beat, all from memory.  “That’s why I love that movie,” Mr. Cruz said as he finished to applause.  It wasn’t the first time that “The Princess Bride” made its way into Mr. Cruz’s campaign.  During a campaign event last month at Iowa Central Community College, Mr. Cruz quoted the movie while criticizing media reports on the Affordable Care Act.   “You keep on using that word, I do not think it means what you think it means,” he told the crowd, in the Spanish staccato of Mr. Montoya. “That’s inconceivable!” a man shouted from the audience, quoting another famous line from the movie.  Mr. Cruz was impressed.  “Now that’s the best line,” he said to the man, before quickly dropping back into Mr. Montoya. “Allo, my name is Inigo Montoya. Prepare to die.” The crowd laughed, as did Mr. Cruz.  “I’m playing all week,” he said.
