 NASHUA, N.H. — Among his varied attacks on Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, Donald J. Trump has taken issue with a loan the senator received (and did not properly disclose) from Goldman Sachs in 2012. On Wednesday, Mr. Cruz delivered a rebuttal: That’s rich. Arguing that Mr. Trump himself had extensive loans “from giant Wall Street banks,” Mr. Cruz said the criticism from Mr. Trump, “to use a New York term, is the height of chutzpah.” “And Heidi and I did something that is very novel and unfamiliar to Donald,” Mr. Cruz told the crowd at a town hall-style event here. “We paid it back.” The loan has become a headache for Mr. Cruz since a New York Times report last month about his failure to disclose it appropriately during his Senate run. It has also drawn attention to his wife Heidi’s job with the firm, from which she has taken an unpaid leave for the campaign. Mr. Cruz was asked Wednesday if his background represented a “conflict of interest” for someone whose campaign is premised in part on a populist crusade against cronyism. Mr. Cruz took the opportunity to speak in more detail than usual about his wife’s business life.  “What she does is not involved with the government. She is investing money for families in and around Texas,” Mr. Cruz said. “She’s essentially a stockbroker.” He said the family took the loan from Goldman in 2012 because of the wealth of his opponent in the Senate race, David Dewhurst. “It’s a good thing I never had to run against a rich guy again,” he joked. A short while later, Mr. Cruz was interrupted by at least a dozen demonstrators, who seemed to be protesting Mr. Cruz’s denial of global warming. “You can’t win New Hampshire like you won Iowa!” one shouted.  As they were escorted out, Mr. Cruz paced the stage quietly. “Someone has invited the children to the event,” he said. “And it does seem that these particular children attended the Donald Trump school of debate: If the facts are uncomfortable, simply yell and scream and stomp your feet.”
