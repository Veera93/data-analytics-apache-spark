 Dr. No seems to have become Dr. Yes. Kind of. Tom Coburn, the former Republican senator from Oklahoma known for his often contrarian views, said Wednesday that Judge Merrick B. Garland should get a vote by the Senate Judiciary Committee, going against his old colleagues who have staunchly opposed even considering President Obama’s Supreme Court nominee in a presidential election year. But he made it clear that did not mean he believed Judge Garland should be confirmed; rather, he said, senators could still make their opposition known through voting on him. “If I was running things, I’d have had a vote and vote him down,” Mr. Coburn said. Mr. Coburn, who retired in 2014 and was at the Capitol to testify about government waste, said he did not believe Judge Garland should get a hearing, pointing out that such a thing is a relatively new concept; senators used to meet with nominees, then vote on them without a panel questioning them first. “I don’t know if he deserves a hearing,” he said. “He deserves a vote out of the committee.” Despite once being among the most conservative members of the Senate, Mr. Coburn took pride in his ability to work with Democrats. He made it clear Wednesday that he believed Republicans were motivated by politics in refusing to consider Mr. Obama’s pick to replace the conservative-leaning Justice Antonin Scalia, who died in February. “The presidents have a right to have their nominees considered,” he said. “And if it had been a Republican president, I’m sure they’d have been considering him.” Oklahoma’s senators now, James M. Inhofe and James Lankford, are scheduled to meet with Judge Garland on Wednesday. Mr. Inhofe and Mr. Lankford, two Republicans, have said they do not think Judge Garland should be considered this year.
