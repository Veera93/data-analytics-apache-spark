 Donald J. Trump has acknowledged that he likes to brand his rivals with belittling monikers that tend to stick. There was “Low Energy” Jeb Bush, “Little” Marco Rubio and “Lyin'” Ted Cruz. Now the Fox News anchor Megyn Kelly, perhaps his favorite foil, has been given one of her own: “Crazy Megyn.” While taking some time off the campaign trail on Thursday, Mr. Trump had Ms. Kelly on his mind, firing off a series of Twitter posts mocking her recent interview with Ted Cruz and calling her program a “hit piece” against him. — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 17, 2016  Mr. Trump started using the term to describe Ms. Kelly as election results were coming in on Tuesday. He called her “crazy” several times that night because he felt that she was not covering him fairly. Mr. Trump’s characterization of Ms. Kelly as crazy is the latest episode in a feud between them that started last year when, during a presidential debate, she questioned his history of making sexist remarks. He later attributed her tough questioning to the possibility that she was menstruating. Some find the term “crazy” to be a sexist suggestion that women are overly emotional or hysterical. Our Principles PAC quoted Mr. Trump using the word in an advertisement last week that detailed his history of belittling women. In that context Mr. Trump was referring to the Diana, Princess of Wales, who he said in a 1997 interview he would have slept with despite her personality. “She was crazy, but these are minor details,” Mr. Trump told the radio host Howard Stern at the time, while noting her good looks.
