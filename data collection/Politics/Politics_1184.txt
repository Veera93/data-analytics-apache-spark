 Ted Cruz is on a six-day, 28-town swing through Iowa. These are the places, faces and culinary selections of 2016’s first proper bus tour. EVENT 26 Time: 2:27 p.m., Jan. 9 Place: Oelwein, Iowa (population: 6,415) Site: Luigi’s Restaurant, with a model cannon, a disco ball and a giant painting of a possibly Italian coastline Mood: Amore, with Cruz lawn signs Food: Uncle Dominic’s Italian beef dinner, Luigi’s Tour of Italy, Steak Vesuvius Tough love: Mr. Cruz, whose older daughter, Caroline, is the frequent subject of gentle stump speech teasing, had begun an anecdote about the 7-year-old when a baby began crying. “She makes us do that a lot,” Mr. Cruz said. Highlight: “Would it kill Republicans to crack a joke?” Mr. Cruz asked, describing how the party could better appeal to young voters. “Actually, I think some of them, it might.” Mr. Cruz has had no such qualms this trip. He recalled for the crowd a series of posters, unaffiliated with his campaign, that had appeared in Los Angeles. They depicted the candidate shirtless (with eight-pack abs), heavily tattooed and smoking a cigarette. “I noticed a glaring error,” Mr. Cruz said, echoing his campaign’s response at the time. “I don’t smoke cigarettes.” — Ted Cruz (@tedcruz) March 15, 2014
