 The Florida Republican Party is a house divided these days. But on Friday, its faithful will come together under one roof not far from Walt Disney World and will try their best to at least make it look like the Happiest Place on Earth. Senator Marco Rubio, the state’s junior senator and a rising candidate for president, helped open the festivities, the Sunshine Summit, with a speech on Thursday night that made light of his history as something of a party crasher.  “Five years ago, when this party was under different leadership, I couldn’t even get a table,” he told the dinnertime crowd, a reference to his race in the 2010 Republican Senate primary against Charlie Crist, the sitting governor at the time. Mr. Rubio forced him out of the race and won the seat. The Florida statesman whom Mr. Rubio is trying to unseat now, Jeb Bush, the state’s former governor, was not in attendance. He was invited but spent the day campaigning in New Hampshire in an effort to lift his mediocre poll numbers. Both he and Mr. Rubio will speak on Friday, but several hours apart.  Other candidates including Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, Donald J. Trump and Ben Carson are also scheduled to speak.
