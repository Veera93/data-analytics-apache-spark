 Hillary Clinton will spend her last Saturday before the Iowa caucuses hitting Bernie Sanders on the issue that could potentially hurt him the most: guns. At a rally in Ames, Mrs. Clinton will join Gabrielle Giffords, the former Arizona congresswoman who was targeted in a mass shooting in 2011, and Ms. Giffords’s husband, the astronaut Mark Kelly, to reiterate her support for increased gun-control measures and to call out Mr. Sanders’s record as a senator representing the rural state of Vermont. The Clinton campaign said in a statement previewing the Saturday rally: “As President Obama stated last month, Americans should vote based on a candidate’s record and willingness to take on the gun lobby.  “Unfortunately, throughout his career, Senator Sanders has failed to meet the president’s test.” Mr. Sanders’s previous positions on gun issues included voting against the Brady Bill and supporting legislation that protected gun sellers from being held liable for crimes committed with firearms. The issue is one that Mr. Sanders’s campaign realizes could be a problem for Iowa caucusgoers. Earlier this week, the campaign sent out a mailer titled “A Lifelong Advocate for Gun Safety,” which highlighted Mr. Sanders’s “D-” grade from the National Rifle Association.  Jeff Weaver, the senator’s campaign manager, has accused Mrs. Clinton of “repeatedly” changing her views on gun safety “from one election to another.” The support of Ms. Giffords and Mr. Kelly, who have become forceful advocates for increased gun-control measures after the shooting in Tucson, give Mrs. Clinton credibility on the issue. Her daughter, Chelsea Clinton, will also attend the organizing event, as her mother makes a final pitch to Iowans.
