 As Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont prepares for a major rally  in Nevada on Sunday, his state director there is leaving the campaign, an aide to the candidate confirmed. The director, Jim Farrell, a Democratic strategist with ties to New Mexico, had only recently taken the position. But Michael Briggs, a spokesman for Mr. Sanders, confirmed that he will be leaving the team. “Jim did a great job organizing a rally tonight in Las Vegas that’s expected to be one of the biggest in Nevada so far this campaign,” Mr. Briggs said in an email. “He did have a family issue come up and is moving on,” he added. Mr. Farrell didn’t immediately respond to a call for comment. Mr. Sanders was in Nevada, a crucial early caucus state, on Sunday evening. His campaign has been trying to ratchet up quickly to match the behemoth of a campaign that Hillary Rodham Clinton has constructed. That task could be made more difficult when a top aide in an early state quits with roughly three months to go until the caucuses, which Mrs. Clinton won in 2008 and which require organizational strength. Later on Sunday evening, Mr. Briggs said that Joan Kato, the campaign’s political director in Nevada, had been promoted to replace Mr. Farrell. He described her as on leave from the State Department, and said she has past caucus experiences on national races.
