 Washington is bracing for a potential shutdown this weekend, and, this time, it won’t be Senator Ted Cruz of Texas’ fault. A winter storm is expected to dump as much as two feet of snow on a city that does not handle it well. The Senate quickly finished the week’s business Thursday morning after gridlock of the traffic variety struck the capital region on Wednesday night because major highways were coated in ice. Some motorists idled for hours trying to get home, and others gave up and abandoned their vehicles in one of the worst local commutes in years. Lawmakers raced for the airports, eager to escape the bigger storm. Those staying behind were bracing for a snowbound weekend with politics far on the back burner. Both the House and the Senate are due to return next week. Whether Washington will be back to normal is anyone’s guess. The storm is not expected to have a significant impact on the presidential campaign trail: Iowa is out of its path and New Hampshire is expected to be, though Washington-based staff members may have trouble linking up with their candidates. Gov. Chris Christie will be paying close attention to his phone as the snow barrels toward New Jersey. Mr. Christie, who has exchanged attacks with Senator Marco Rubio of Florida over who spends the least time worrying about their constituents, is not rescheduling his campaign events in New Hampshire this weekend, and is delegating some of the storm preparation to his deputies. Local lawmakers noticed this plan from Mr. Christie, who has called his experience handling the aftermath of Hurricane Sandy a pivotal leadership test. “Executives should be working during a time when you have a serious storm,” said Stephen M. Sweeney, a Democrat and president of the New Jersey Senate.
