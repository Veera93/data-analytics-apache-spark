 As Jeb Bush’s campaign prepares to hold a fund-raiser in Connecticut, for which buying a ticket is not required, the main rival who he has been watching, Marco Rubio, is picking up the support of one of the state’s wealthy hedge fund managers, according to an invitation to an event next month.  Mr. Rubio’s campaign will hold a fund-raiser on Nov. 5 at the home of Alex and Christine Seaver in New Canaan, Conn. Tickets to the event will cost the maximum price, $2,700, that can be donated in the nominating race, the invitation to the event shows.  Connecticut has long been considered Mr. Bush’s turf, given the family’s connection to the state — his grandfather, Prescott Bush, served as a senator there.  But Mr. Bush’s campaign has been struggling to raise campaign cash over the last few months, as his numbers in the polls have not moved. Mr. Rubio, the Florida senator, has been trying to capitalize on the nervousness of Mr. Bush’s donors.  Mr. Bush, the former Florida governor, is holding an event this weekend in Connecticut, to which attendees have been invited at no cost.  While Mr. Bush’s fund-raiser was touted as an event people could attend for free, his aides insisted they were still able to raise roughly $275,000 for it.
