 A Bush family portrait. A book signed by Donald J. Trump. Six yards of mulch. At a local Republican dinner in Bettendorf, Iowa, on Tuesday evening, Jeb Bush commanded top billing, kicking off a three-day Iowa swing with a keynote speech at a trying moment in his campaign. But in the event space where Mr. Bush spoke, an eclectic medley of silent auction fodder — two rib-eye steaks, Bush-Quayle and Bush-Cheney campaign buttons, a “concealed carry package,” the prose of Bill O’Reilly — was not to be ignored. Guests at the gathering, organized by the Scott County Republicans, stopped often to bid or, at least, to investigate. What to make of the “whimsical” elephant necklaces? The Ted Cruz book, packaged with “Green Eggs and Ham,” which he once read on the Senate floor? The photo of Jeb and George H.W. Bush playing tennis? “Value: Priceless,” read an attached appraisal, optimistically. Most candidates’ books were valued at $30. (The autobiography of Scott Walker, the Wisconsin governor who left the presidential race last month, struggled to attract bids.) Some items fared better. Paul D. Pate, Iowa’s secretary of state, lingered beside an image labeled “Republican Satire Print.” It depicted an elephant standing atop a map of the United States, with a donkey tumbling into the Pacific Ocean. He bid $100.
