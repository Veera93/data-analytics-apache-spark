 Ted Cruz is on a six-day, 28-town swing through Iowa. These are the places, faces and culinary selections of 2016’s first proper bus tour. EVENT 6 Time: 11:15 a.m., Jan. 5 Place: Onawa, Iowa (population: 2,998) Site: Onawa Library, in an upstairs room with a wooden stage Mood: shushing librarian’s nightmare On-site video game box set: “Dance Dance Revolution Hottest Party 2″ Buttons available for purchase: “I Only Date Republicans,” “Foxy Ladies Vote Republican,” “D.A.D.D.D.: Dad’s Against Daughters Dating Democrats.” (The vendors are not affiliated with the campaign, but often follow Mr. Cruz to events.) Highlight: After his speech, Mr. Cruz was approached by a blind man, who quietly told the senator a joke before praising him as the most promising conservative since Ronald Reagan. Mr. Cruz summoned a reporter to quote the voter. The man repeated the Reagan line. “Tell the first line,” Mr. Cruz instructed.  His guest obliged. “I’m blind,” he began, “but I can still see through Hillary Clinton.”
