 The “super PAC” that was supporting Donald J. Trump before it shuttered amid questions about its ties to the candidate’s top operative returned $1 million to a donor who then sent it to the Trump Foundation, according to a report by Political Money Line.  The $1 million contribution from Phil Ruffin, an investor, was made on July 16. It was refunded to Mr. Ruffin after the super PAC was closed down. But Mr. Ruffin, who is part of a business deal with Mr. Trump at his Las Vegas hotel property, later gave precisely that amount to the event that Mr. Trump threw to benefit veterans, and to run as counterprogramming to the last Republican presidential debate before the Iowa caucuses. Mr. Trump has repeatedly singled out Mr. Ruffin as one of the donors.  The group raised $1.7 million and disbursed $1.5 million, according to its filings with the Federal Election Commission.  That spending included more than $160,000 on polling.  Mr. Trump repeatedly boasted in 2015 that he did not want super PAC money. But the group, Make America Great Again PAC — using Mr. Trump’s campaign slogan — was run primarily by a Colorado-based vendor, Mike Ciletti, who had worked with Mr. Trump’s campaign manager, Corey Lewandowski, when Mr. Lewandowski worked at the group Americans for Prosperity.  A firm that Mr. Ciletti is connected to was also being used as a vendor by the campaign. In the last campaign filing, that firm received a boost of roughly $500,000 in payments after the super PAC was closed, according to The Washington Post.
