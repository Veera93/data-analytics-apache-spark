 Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont plans to spend Monday campaigning across Indiana, holding three rallies on the final day before the state primary and hoping to pull off a win after a tough week of election losses and campaign layoffs. A win in Indiana, where Mr. Sanders and Hillary Clinton are in a tight race, could help Mr. Sanders regain some momentum, and an NBC News/Wall Street Journal/Marist poll released on Sunday showed them in a virtual tie in the state. At a rally on Sunday night in South Bend, Ind., Mr. Sanders told thousands of supporters that he saw the state as important to helping him win the nomination. Still, last week, amid staff reductions, he began focusing less on attacking Mrs. Clinton and more on his views for shaping the Democratic Party. Mr. Sanders, who trails Mrs. Clinton by more than 700 pledged delegates and superdelegates, spent Sunday afternoon urging the superdelegates supporting Mrs. Clinton to his side. He argued that many had given her their support before he entered the race and that he thought those from states he won should follow the voters’ lead. The senator also said on Sunday that he and Mrs. Clinton were heading for a “contested” convention because she needs those superdelegates to reach the delegate threshold, rather than relying solely on the pledged delegates won through the state contests. Superdelegates, however, are widely considered to be part of the necessary delegate count, and Barack Obama needed them to secure the nomination against Mrs. Clinton in 2008. Figures released on Sunday also showed that Mr. Sanders raised just $25.8 million for his campaign in April, down by more than 40 percent from March. Seeking to minimize the drop in fund-raising, the campaign’s spokesman, Michael Briggs, emphasized that Mr. Sanders’s average monthly fund-raising total was only $17 million. But that factors in Mr. Sanders’s fund-raising going back a full year to the start of his campaign.
