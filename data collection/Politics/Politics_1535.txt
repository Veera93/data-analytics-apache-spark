 Don’t say Donald J. Trump hasn’t done Jim Gilmore any favors. Mr. Trump’s appearance as host of “Saturday Night Live” this month led to equal airtime complaints from some of his lesser-known rivals for the Republican presidential nomination. Mr. Gilmore, who has not qualified for the Republican debates and does not register in most polls, is taking N.B.C. up on the opportunity to get some free time on its network this weekend – an offer intended to ensure that candidates do not receive unfair media advantages. “This is about fairness,” Mr. Gilmore, a former governor of Virginia, said. “N.B.C. allowed Trump to appear in a non-news setting and that is a violation of the fairness doctrine where other candidates are concerned.” When he decided to run last summer, Mr. Gilmore said that he thought other candidates were not taking international threats seriously enough. He is using his free airtime to demonstrate his national security credentials. “I’m not a Washington politician, or an amateur,” Mr. Gilmore says in his 30-second ad that shows masked militants ready to attack. “As president, I will defeat ISIS and keep you safe.” The ad will air on 18 N.B.C. affiliates in Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina over the next few says. The network is also granting time to Gov. John Kasich of Ohio, Mike Huckabee and Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina.
