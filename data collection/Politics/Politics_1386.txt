 Most presidential candidates spend debate days brushing up on their policy points, getting in a bit of exercise or trying to relax before stepping into the spotlight. As this election cycle has shown, Donald J. Trump is not an ordinary candidate. Mr. Trump spent the hours before the CNN debate on Tuesday prepping at his Trump International Hotel, meeting with the casino mogul Sheldon Adelson and ranting about Megyn Kelly, the Fox News anchor who has been the target of his attacks. — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 15, 2015  Mr. Trump and Ms. Kelly have had bad blood between them since the first Republican debate, when her pointed questioning of his treatment of women got under his skin. He later suggested that she lacked integrity and insinuated that she was feeling hormonal during the debate. After making peace with the network for awhile, Mr. Trump unleashed a storm of Twitter posts against Ms. Kelly on Tuesday after she misstated his lead over Senator Ted Cruz in a national poll. He said she was a “dopey” liar, “very bad at math” and “highly overrated.” If Mr. Trump’s tirade was the product of nervous energy, he was not letting on about it. “I’ve been ready a long time,” he told The Washington Post before the debate. “I’ve been ready my whole life.”
