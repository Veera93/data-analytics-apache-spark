 Hillary Clinton raised $29.5 million in March, her campaign announced on Monday, far less than the $44 million raised by Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont during the same period. The totals make March the third month in a row that Mr. Sanders has raised more than Mrs. Clinton, despite her lead in delegates and the support of most of the Democratic Party’s major donors. Mrs. Clinton also raised $6.1 million for the Democratic National Committee and state parties, money that now accounts for a large portion of the national party’s monthly revenue. Mrs. Clinton’s campaign said that half of the donations came online but did not reveal what proportion of the overall money came from donors giving less than $200, a common benchmark for grass-roots fund-raising strength. Her campaign manager, Robby Mook, said in a statement: “As Hillary Clinton has progressed through the primary, we’ve seen a surge of grass-roots support across the country and are thrilled that we now have more than one million contributors to this campaign, most of whom have given less than $100.” Equally unclear was which candidate had the advantage in cash on hand going into April. Both campaigns have been spending at a furious pace, with Mr. Sanders’s overall burn rate slightly ahead of Mrs. Clinton’s. Mrs. Clinton began April with $29 million in cash, her campaign said. Mr. Sanders’s campaign has not disclosed his cash on hand figure.
