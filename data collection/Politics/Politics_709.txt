 Donald J. Trump lent his campaign nearly $5 million in January, increasing his total loans to $17.5 million, and he substantially quickened his spending during the month, according to campaign finance reports filed Saturday.  Mr. Trump spent nearly $11.5 million in January, about what he had spent over the previous six months, according to his latest filings with the Federal Election Commission.  The bulk of the spending, more than $7 million, appears to have been for television ads. He did not begin airing ads until around the holidays. Other expenditures were the campaign’s reams of red hats emblazoned with his slogan, “Make America Great Again,” as well as lawn signs and bumper stickers. He showed no payments for any internal polling. He frequently boasts that, unlike other candidates, he does not need to conduct polls because the news media, in effect, does it for him for free. Mr. Trump once boasted that he was self-funding his campaign, and more recently began acknowledging that he was receiving donations. He raised nearly $950,000 from contributors in January, the filings show.
