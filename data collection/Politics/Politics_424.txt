 In the wake of the results of the contests in Arizona and Utah, the dual-track primaries move forward to the next big test, Wisconsin, on April 5. But in the Republican battle, Senator Ted Cruz of Texas is spending time on Donald J. Trump’s turf for a second day in a row, as he tries to galvanize support in the establishment behind his candidacy.  Mr. Cruz’s day began with an announcement of support from Jeb Bush, the former governor of Florida who was the only candidate to spend extensive time battling Mr. Trump directly over many months. Mr. Bush’s endorsement of Mr. Cruz came as the Texas senator made overtures to his colleague, Senator Marco Rubio of Florida, to get behind his candidacy and possibly join him on a ticket.  On Wednesday, he will hold a rally to try to appeal to New York Republicans, some of whom are more closely associated with the state’s former governor, George E. Pataki, a candidate for president until a few months ago. New York will hold Democratic and Republican primaries on April 19.  Mr. Trump, after giving extensive interviews on Tuesday about the attacks in Brussels, is taking a few days away from the campaign trail. He used those opportunities to repeatedly raise alarm about Muslim immigrants coming into the United States, saying that the attacks in Brussels were an example of his ability to make “prognostications” about what’s to come.  As for the Democrats, Hillary Clinton plans to give a counterterrorism speech while she is in California. Mrs. Clinton has been careful not to publicly step ahead of President Obama during moments of developing crises, and she continues to face a difficult challenge of presenting herself as the best continuation of the Obama administration, while charting her own course.
