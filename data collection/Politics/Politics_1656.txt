 Hillary Rodham Clinton is under fire from Republicans for failing to come to the defense of Carly Fiorina on Tuesday after a man at a campaign event said that he wished he could reach out and strangle Ms. Fiorina. During the event in New Hampshire, at which Mrs. Clinton was detailing plans to reform the Department of Veterans Affairs, the man told Mrs. Clinton that Mrs. Fiorina, the former chief executive of Hewlett-Packard, had fired him and thousands of others to cut costs, and then spent money to buy jets to fly executives around the world. “She says she’s a great C.E.O.,” the man said, recounting how lives were ruined by the job cuts that Mrs. Fiorina imposed. “Every time I see her on TV, I want to reach through and strangle her.” Mrs. Clinton responded with loud laughter and said, “I wouldn’t mess with you!” Republicans denounced Mrs. Clinton for failing to condemn the apparent threat of violence against Mrs. Fiorina, the only other woman running for president this year, and suggested that Mrs. Clinton was a hypocrite for calling herself a champion of women. “By laughing off a male questioner’s desire to strangle Carly Fiorina, Hillary Clinton and the Democrats have lost all credibility claiming to be a party that stands up for women,” said Allison Moore, a spokeswoman for the Republican National Committee. “Jokes about committing acts of violence against women are always in poor taste and should be condemned every time.” Candidates often face a delicate dance when supporters characterize rivals in raw terms. Donald J. Trump was criticized this year for failing to correct a supporter who said that President Obama was a Muslim. On Tuesday, Mrs. Clinton brushed it off when the man in New Hampshire said how much it upset him when Mrs. Fiorina called Mrs. Clinton a liar. “Well, unfortunately, that’s the political season we’re in,” Mrs. Clinton said.
