 Ben Carson has gained ground on Donald J. Trump in a new poll from Fox News and is now in a statistical tie with the billionaire developer, who has been leading the crowded Republican pack for months. A survey of likely Republican voters found that 24 percent supported Mr. Trump and 23 percent backed Mr. Carson. The poll had a margin of error of plus or minus five percentage points. For months, Mr. Trump has boasted that he leads all state and national polls of Republicans, defying controversies and mixed debate performances. But Mr. Carson, a soft-spoken retired neurosurgeon, has slowly been gaining ground on Mr. Trump and now threatens to overshadow his front-runner aura. Mr. Carson and Mr. Trump have largely been cordial to each other on the campaign trail, but that could change now that Mr. Trump’s lead is at risk. So far Mr. Trump has aggressively attacked candidates who were gaining on him, and he has been successful at keeping establishment rivals such as Jeb Bush and Senator Marco Rubio and upstarts such as Carly Fiorina at bay. The rest of the Republican field remains muddled in the latest Fox poll, with Senator Ted Cruz, Mr. Rubio and Mr. Bush stuck at 10 percent, 9 percent and 8 percent, respectively. Mrs. Fiorina, who was boosted after a strong debate performance last month, has fallen back to 5 percent. The poll could spell trouble for candidates who are fighting for placement in the Republican debate later this month. Gov. Chris Christie, Gov. Bobby Jindal and Gov. John Kasich are hovering at 1 percent, and Senator Lindsey Graham and Rick Santorum failed to register at all.
