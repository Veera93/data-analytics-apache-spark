 The nation’s drug crisis has grabbed the attention of the presidential candidates and of Congress, as Republicans and Democrats are eager to be seen responding to a problem that has hit many of their communities hard. The Senate Judiciary Committee is poised on Thursday to pass a measure aimed at improving treatment and prevention programs around the country. The bill, which is likely to hit the Senate floor after next week’s recess, is expected to have bipartisan support. What it doesn’t have is federal money behind it.  As a result, immediately after the bill passes, Senate Democrats will hold a news conference to chide Senate Republicans to “back up their rhetoric and support desperately needed emergency supplemental funding,” according to a news release from Democratic leaders, even as they throw their support behind the bipartisan measure.  Senator Jeanne Shaheen, Democrat of New Hampshire, where the drug crisis was a major topic both in debates and in the presidential candidates’ campaign events, has introduced a $600 million funding request for research, intervention and recovery efforts. Democrats will almost certainly press to make that measure part of any authorization bill.  Aspects of the bill the Senate is expected to consider include the development of a national education campaign, treatment alternatives to prison programs, a National Task Force on Recovery and the authorization — though no funding — of grants for family-based substance abuse treatment. The tension between the Republican desire to pass modest bipartisan policy bills and the Democrats’ pressing for more money to pay for them is likely to play out repeatedly for the rest of this Congress, and it could keep the issue near the front of the presidential race.
