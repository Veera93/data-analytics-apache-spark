 The signal was visible on Wednesday afternoon, when Senator Mitch McConnell, the Kentucky Republican and majority leader, was spotted strolling through the Capitol in a pair of jeans. Republicans have begun their annual retreat, where their policy goals are hashed out in a hotel ballroom.  This year’s retreat, which runs Thursday and Friday in Baltimore, is the first since John A. Boehner stepped down as House speaker, and the last of the Obama presidency, presenting Republicans with limitations in what they can achieve and opportunities to define their party’s future agenda.  Also, to taste beer. The House and Senate begin in some disagreement. House Speaker Paul D. Ryan, fresh off the aggressive recruitment effort that led to his ascendance, wants his members to come up with a bold policy agenda for 2016, while Mr. McConnell wants to focus on victories that remain possible in a divided government.  Members are at least hoping to agree on the broad outlines of the issues Congress wants to focus on this year, including national security, advancing biomedical research and other health care matters and appropriations, as well as a process for members to fill in the policy details and a general time frame for moving forward, according to House staff members.   There will be myriad breakout sessions on various topics and news media briefings with congressional Republican leaders.  Among speakers expected to entertain the lawmakers are Jim Koch, the founder of the Boston Beer Company, which makes Samuel Adams (that’s the beer part); George Will and Larry Kudlow (that’s the conservative part); Francis S. Collins, the director of the National Institutes of Health (the brainy policy part); and the author and journalist Jon Meacham (the wild-card part).
