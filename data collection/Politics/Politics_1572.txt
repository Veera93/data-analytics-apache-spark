 NEWTON, Iowa — It was a subdued Donald J. Trump who sat for a town-hall-style event focused on the middle class on Thursday here in a town where a Maytag plant closed eight years ago, throwing 1,900 people out of well-paying jobs with benefits. One former employee of the factory, Herman Couples, said: “I watched the town slowly die.’’ Mr. Trump, seated in an armchair, was asked a series of kitchen-sink questions that took him far afield from the usual topics of campaign rallies, though they were issues of concern to many of his blue-collar supporters. His answers were only partly on-topic, and most were light on specifics. How would he help a single parent earning minimum wage who must pay 53 percent of income on child care? “Funny, that is not something you hear about as much,’’ Mr. Trump said. His own hotels offer a “Trumpateers” child care program for employees, he offered. What will you do to make sure women are paid equally to men? Mr. Trump praised his daughter: “Women really respect Ivanka,’’ he said. Government should not be involved, he added, and women need to fight for their pay. How would he help low-wage workers who want to learn a technical skill but need financial aid for tuition and books at community college? Lots of people “have lost their mojo to go to community college,’’ Mr. Trump said. “We have to give people their spirit back.’’ Does he support subsidies for wind power? (A wind turbine factory went into the old Maytag plant.) “Amazing, out of nowhere, out of the wind, they make energy,” Mr. Trump said. “They’re very expensive to build. Without a subsidy, I don’t think they can make it. Which is a big problem.’’ Does he support unions? He has had “great success” in New York building with unions and also in Florida without unions. “If I had my choice,” he said, “I think I’d take it without.’’
