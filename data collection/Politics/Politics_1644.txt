 After a rough and highly personal debate in the Louisiana governor’s race on Tuesday night, all eyes in the Senate are on David Vitter, the Louisiana Republican who is in a pitched battle to win the governor’s mansion back home. Oddly enough, both Senate Republicans and Democrats have ample reason to want Mr. Vitter to win.  A Senate loner, Mr. Vitter has been a thorn in the side of Democrats for years, pushing for politically charged votes, holding out on agreements, holding up bills and not seeming to care whom he has alienated in doing so. Democrats would not be unhappy to see him go. But Republicans might have even more reason to hope that Mr. Vitter is successful in his current race and wins the election on Nov. 21. Mr. Vitter was long seen as the favorite to succeed Gov. Bobby Jindal. But the nonpartisan primary last month and the continuing runoff have renewed attention on Mr. Vitter’s involvement in a 2007 prostitution scandal when his phone number showed up on the log of the so-called D.C. Madam.   The issue did not get much traction in 2010 when Mr. Vitter won re-election to the Senate. But it has this time, with his Democratic opponent, John Bel Edwards, pounding him over it in a brutal ad that Mr. Vitter was forced to answer. Republicans now worry that Mr. Vitter could be damaged goods if he loses this month after exhausting his campaign funds, making him newly vulnerable if he runs for Senate re-election next year. They worry that a Democratic candidate like Mitch Landrieu, the mayor of New Orleans, could put the seat in play if he decides to take on a wounded Mr. Vitter. The last thing Senate Republicans want to be doing is defending what should be a safe seat in Louisiana when they already have their hands full with swing states around the country.
