 NASHUA, N.H. — “This is craziness!” Marco Rubio said on Thursday, finally addressing the buzz over his boots. He seemed both disgusted and amused by the worldwide attention to his sleek high-heel boots after a photograph of them while he was on the campaign trail went viral. “Have they lost their minds?” he said in response to a question at a town hall meeting in Nashua. He suggested that the people who were so fixated on his footwear might have their priorities skewed. “So let me get this right. ISIS is cutting people’s heads off, setting people on fire in cages. Saudi Arabia and Iran are on the verge of a war,” he said, listing several more grave threats to the country’s safety and stability.  And people were worked up about his boots, he asked, incredulous. After two days of campaigning across Iowa and New Hampshire this week as Twitter and cable news convulsed over his choice of footwear, the voter’s question Thursday afternoon forced him to address the issue (he had jettisoned the boots Thursday for a black pair of slip-on dress shoes.) The Florida senator said he had no idea that people were making such a fuss until his children told him on Wednesday night. He confessed, though, that he did like the boots. And he hinted that people might see them again on the trail. “They may make a comeback pretty soon,” Mr. Rubio said. “Stay tuned.”
