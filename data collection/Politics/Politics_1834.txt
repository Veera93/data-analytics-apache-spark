 LAS VEGAS — If he can just make it through his party’s nominating contest, Jeb Bush — who speaks Spanish fluently and is married to a Mexican  — has long held up his ability to win over Hispanic voters in a general election. And on Wednesday evening, he will field questions from the sizable Hispanic population here, the latest Republican to speak at a policy forum sponsored by the Libre Initiative.  Libre, a grass-roots organization backed by the conservative billionaire brothers Charles G. and David H. Koch, is dedicated to promoting the Koch network’s guiding principles of economic freedom and limited government to Hispanics. But it also hopes to win them over through more traditional community organizing, such as helping undocumented immigrants get driver’s licenses and handing out turkeys on Thanksgiving.  Mr. Bush is expected to address the economy, education, health care, immigration and other issues. His scheduled appearance before the group comes a day after a bill to crack down on so-called sanctuary cities, where the authorities do not automatically try to deport undocumented immigrants, failed to advance in the Senate. The bill, which has outraged many pro-immigration and Hispanic groups, was co-sponsored by two of Mr. Bush’s Republican rivals, Senator Ted Cruz of Texas and Senator Marco Rubio of Florida, who addressed a Libre forum this month.
