 Hillary Rodham Clinton met her comedic doppelgänger and poked fun at herself on Saturday night in the season premiere of “Saturday Night Live,” the latest and highest stakes of a string of entertainment shows Mrs. Clinton has appeared on in recent weeks. The scene began with the comedian Kate McKinnon in character with Mrs. Clinton nursing a “scalding hot vodka” at a dive bar as she overhears people talking about voting for Donald J. Trump.  “Oh, Huma, why won’t the people just let me lead?” she said to a glamorous black-haired assistant meant to be Mrs. Clinton’s real-life aide, Huma Abedin. The actual Mrs. Clinton appeared behind the bar, pretending to be a regal bartender and neutral observer in a pressed white dress shirt with the name “Val.” Ms. McKinnon-as-Hillary vented to Val: “I needed to blow off some steam; I’ve had a rough 22 years.” “Val” introduced herself. “I’m just an ordinary citizen who believes the Keystone pipeline will destroy our environment,” she said. (She also poked fun at herself about her relatively late support of same-sex marriage. “Yeah, I could have supported it earlier,” Ms. McKinnon-as-Mrs. Clinton said.) She continued to vent about the state of the presidential campaign, at which point the actual Mrs. Clinton, as Val, put on her best Donald Trump voice. “Isn’t he the one who’s all ‘Ugh, you’re all losers?'” As the two discussed a much-needed vacation, the comedian Darrell Hammond popped up in character as Bill Clinton. “Did somebody say vacation?” a swaggering Mr. Clinton said. He then caught a glimpse of the real and fake Hillary. “My God, they’re multiplying,” he said. Ms. McKinnon, who has said she’s an unabashed Hillary Clinton supporter, ended the skit arm-in-arm with Val. They belted out “Lean on Me,” and the real Mrs. Clinton suddenly vanished,  leaving only a “hard tan business shoe” behind her, like Cinderella after the ball.
