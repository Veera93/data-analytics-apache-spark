 Senator Bernie Sanders stepped off the campaign trail on Monday to have a procedure to repair a hernia. Mr. Sanders, the independent from Vermont and Democratic presidential candidate, had an outpatient procedure at George Washington University Hospital and was expected return to his Senate duties on Tuesday.  Mr. Sanders, 74, has maintained a rigorous schedule in recent months as he juggles running for president with representing Vermont in the Senate. On Sunday night, he was in New Hampshire to speak at the state Democratic Party’s annual Jefferson-Jackson Dinner.  His campaign did not offer any other details regarding Mr. Sanders’s condition other than to say that the procedure was elective.
