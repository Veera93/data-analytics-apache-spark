 The “super PAC” supporting Hillary Rodham Clinton will advertise on television for the first time in the 2016 presidential campaign, running an ad for two days in the first four early nominating states before her congressional testimony Thursday on the 2012 attacks in Benghazi, Libya.  An official with the group, Priorities USA , said the ad buy would focus on her appearance before the House committee investigating the terrorist attacks at the United States diplomatic outpost in Benghazi, which occurred when Mrs. Clinton was secretary of state.  The ad has not been released. But the ad buy, expected to cost six figures, will run on cable networks in New Hampshire, Iowa, Nevada and South Carolina, as well as in Washington, said Justin Barasky, the group’s spokesman.  “Priorities USA is doing everything we can to help Hillary Clinton become the next president of the United States,”  Mr. Barasky said, “and our first television ad of the cycle is part of our efforts.”
