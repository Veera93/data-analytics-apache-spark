 COLUMBIA, S.C. — W. stands for winner — at least that’s what Jeb Bush’s campaign is hoping.  On Thursday, the Bush team made official what had long been an open secret — that former President George W. Bush will hit the campaign trail on Monday evening with his younger brother in North Charleston, S.C. The decision to deploy the former president, who remains popular with the Republican base, especially in South Carolina with its large military and veteran population, comes as the state has emerged as crucial to the Jeb Bush campaign as it seeks to keep nervous donors from bolting. Jeb Bush hopes to leverage his fourth-place to finish in New Hampshire, just ahead of Senator Marco Rubio of Florida, into a strong showing in a state that still regards the Bush family fondly. But having George W. campaign for his brother has been a delicate issue for the campaign. Jeb Bush has struggled with how to handle his famous last name, and with the reality that some voters simply do not want to see another Bush in the White House.  Early on in the campaign, Mr. Bush bungled a question about if he would have authorized the 2003 invasion of Iraq, as his brother did, with the intelligence available today. At first, he said he would have, only to backpedal and say several days later than he had misunderstood the original question. But South Carolina is now a critical state for Mr. Bush, just as it was for his brother in 2000. And so, Monday evening — President’s Day, for those into heavy-handed symbolism — the 43rd president and the one who hopes to be the 45th will take the stage together at a rally.
