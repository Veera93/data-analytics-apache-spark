 Bill Clinton is officially getting back on the campaign trail. The former president is joining his wife, Hillary Rodham Clinton, at a rally in Des Moines on Saturday before the Democratic Party’s annual Jefferson-Jackson Dinner. The pop-star Katy Perry will also attend, according to the campaign. While Mr. Clinton has spoken on his wife’s behalf in this election cycle, it will be his debut at a big rally. The appearance comes as Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. is mulling his own White House bid, with an announcement possible as early as this week.  Mr. Clinton can be a dazzling public speaker, but he also has a tendency to stir controversy with off-the-cuff remarks. In the 2008 presidential campaign, he angered some African-Americans when he suggested that Senator Barack Obama’s opposition to the Iraq war was “the biggest fairy tale I’ve ever seen.” However, Mr. Clinton brings significant political star power to Mrs. Clinton’s campaign and represents her most powerful advocate. Last month, in an interview with CNN, Mr. Clinton signaled that he would probably take a more active role in the campaign in the fall and would “go talk to her supporters and tell them what I think they should know, and answer their questions, and free her up to campaign more.”
