 Hillary Rodham Clinton took a break from fund-raising in Chicago on Monday to meet with the mothers and family members of several black men killed by white police officers and others who have been affected by gun violence. In a private conversation that included the mothers of Michael Brown, Tamir Rice, Trayvon Martin and others, Mrs. Clinton reaffirmed her pledge to overhaul the criminal justice system, a campaign aide said. She also asked how trust could be restored between police officers and predominantly African-American communities in light of a spate of killings. “We have allowed our criminal justice system to get out of balance,” Mrs. Clinton has said, citing what she has called systemic racism. As the streets of Baltimore erupted in protest in April after the death of Freddie Gray from injuries he suffered while in policy custody, Mrs. Clinton made race, poverty and the incarceration of men from poor, black communities central to her early campaign. “There is something profoundly wrong when African-American men are still far more likely to be stopped and searched by police, charged with crimes and sentenced to longer prison terms than are meted out to their white counterparts,” Mrs. Clinton said in her first major policy speech in April. Since then she has devoted much attention to the topic, not always appeasing the audience. Last week, protestors affiliated with the Black Lives Matter movement interrupted Mrs. Clinton as she spoke at an “African Americans for Hillary” kickoff event in Atlanta. “I am sorry they didn’t listen because some of what they are demanding, I am offering,” Mrs. Clinton said. The meeting on Monday, first reported by CNN, had been in the works for months, Mrs. Clinton’s campaign said.
