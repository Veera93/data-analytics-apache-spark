 When the word broke last Saturday that Justice Antonin Scalia had died, the field of Republican candidates had already spent time in South Carolina discussing the possibility of a vacancy. The state’s attorney general, Alan Wilson, had been working with the Conservative Leadership Project, a political group, to focus attention on the fact that four sitting justices were born in the 1930s, and to call attention to the potential for the next president to fill at least one vacancy. Mr. Wilson and the group held a series of forums with different candidates.  Among those who spoke was Donald J. Trump, who said at a forum in December, “I’d want strongly conservative people, but I’d want great scholars,” when explaining his view of replacements. So did Senator Marco Rubio of Florida, who said, “The fundamental question when appointing someone to the Supreme Court, and quite frankly, any appellate court, is, ‘What do they believe about the Constitution?’ ”  In South Carolina, Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, a skilled lawyer, has used the time since Mr. Scalia’s death to remind his supporters that he believes the court has run amok with activist decisions.
