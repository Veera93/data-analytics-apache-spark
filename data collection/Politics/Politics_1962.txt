 Donald J. Trump flatly rejected the notion that he has plans to abandon his presidential bid, vowing on Tuesday that he intends to win. The billionaire developer’s plans have been subject to speculation because of recent polls that have showed his lead in the crowded Republican field narrowing and the suspicion that he would not subject himself to humiliating losses once caucuses and primaries begin next year. In an interview with CNN on Tuesday, Mr. Trump denounced such suggestions as nonsense. “I’m not going anywhere,” Mr. Trump said. “I’m leading every poll. I’m going to win and I’m going to make our country great again.” Over the weekend, Mr. Trump said on NBC’s “Meet the Press” that if he was collapsing in the polls and the public lost interest in his campaign, then he would not subject himself to the nominating process indefinitely. Claiming he is not like some of his rivals who are persevering despite single-digit poll numbers, Mr. Trump said that he is not a “masochist” and that he would be fine returning to his business if his campaign flounders. Mr. Trump said on Tuesday that his answer was not intended to signal that he was plotting his exit strategy and accused critics of cherry-picking polls that showed his lead contracting. “I’m not in this to have self-glorification, I’ve had plenty of that,” Mr. Trump said. “And right now I’m leading, I’m winning, I’m winning by big numbers.”
