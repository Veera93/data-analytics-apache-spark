 The “super PAC” supporting Jeb Bush is running a brutal ad against Donald J. Trump in South Carolina, the latest in a string of negative spots to take on the Republican candidate who is leading the polls. The ad even takes a shot at Senator Marco Rubio, putting his face on a robot – a reference to the candidate’s widely panned debate performance last weekend. But the spot saves most of its fire for Mr. Trump, hitting him for criticizing the Fox News anchor Megyn Kelly, associating with the Clintons, and for criticizing Senator John McCain. The defense of Mr. McCain is telling in light of the nasty primary between him and Mr. Bush’s brother, George W. Bush, in 2000 in South Carolina. Still, the ad paints Mr. Bush as the only candidate to firmly stand up to Mr. Trump, who is now the focus of  number of negative ads in the last days before the Feb. 20 Republican primary. The ad is a companion to another spot, running on national cable networks, showing Mr. Trump as a huge ice sculpture melting as the narrator ticks off ways in which he has not been consistent on core conservative issues like abortion.  For months, donors and some Republican operatives had wondered why the super PAC had not moved faster to try to take down Mr. Trump and damage his standing in the polls.
