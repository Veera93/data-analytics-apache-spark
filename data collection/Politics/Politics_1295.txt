 Seven months after he declared his candidacy in New Hampshire, George E. Pataki is calling it quits. The moderate conservative policies that made him successful as the governor of New York failed to catch on in a 2016 Republican nominating contest that has been dominated by political outsiders and firebrands. The kickoff: In Exeter’s crowded town hall, Mr. Pataki promised to cut taxes, cure cancer and crush the Islamic State. “After 12 years of my conservative policies, we replaced dependency with opportunity, resignation with hope, mere existence with dreams, a welfare check with a paycheck,” Mr. Pataki said. “I know we can do the same thing for the United States.” The strategy: With a lack of substantial fundraising, Mr. Pataki spent much of his time in New Hampshire, hoping that he could steal an early primary state with a tradition of independent-mindedness.  The hiatus: Mr. Pataki took a brief break from the campaign trail in June after his son-in-law had a stroke on an airplane.  The debates: His poll numbers hovering around zero, Mr. Pataki was relegated to the “undercard” Republican presidential debates. He occasionally criticized Donald J. Trump and bemoaned the direction of the Republican Party, but failed to stand out next to feistier candidates. The ballots: By early December, Mr. Pataki was not on the primary ballots in four states, including Florida. David Catalfamo, a spokesman for the former governor, said that the Trump effect had skewed poll numbers and made it difficult to compete. “This primary has been like no other in recent history, and the campaign is competing within our available resources,” Mr. Catalfamo said. The end: On Tuesday night, he concluded his campaign during the airing of “Chicago Med” on NBC affiliates in Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina.
