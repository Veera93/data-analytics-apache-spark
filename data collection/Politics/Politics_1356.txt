 They may be stuck in rope lines rather than movie-ticket lines, but some 2016 presidential candidates certainly have Star Wars on the mind. Jeb Bush, who has been known to turn his “Jeb!” logo into “Jedi” with a #ForceFriday hashtag, lamented to Business Insider that he would probably have to wait until March to see the film because he had not prepurchased tickets. He said he was not a fan of the most recent movies, but was hoping that the decision of the director, J. J. Abrams, to adapt old filming techniques would restore the franchise’s greatness. Senator Ted Cruz, who says he is a fan of the series, told ABC last week how excited he was for the new film, performed a Yoda impression and suggested the network ask each presidential candidate which Star Wars character they would be. “Anyone who says Luke Skywalker ought to be eliminated right off the bat,” he said, jokingly. “The only right answer to that is Han Solo.” Love for Star Wars (or, perhaps, the hope of cashing in on the hype) is bleeding into campaign strategy as well. Mr. Cruz is holding a Star Wars contest on his campaign’s mobile app. The person who scores the most “points,” which are earned through a variety of tasks, like joining the National Prayer Team or canvassing, will receive two tickets to opening weekend. Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky has taken to calling his team of donors and volunteers the “Rebel Alliance,” changing the font of his Twitter cards to have similar big, block letters to the Star Wars titles. And Senator Rob Portman, Republican of Ohio, who is in a re-election battle, put up a minute-long ad on Twitter, done in the scrolling style of the Star Wars intro, titled “Return of the Failed Governor.” One candidate won’t be waiting around to see the movie: Donald J. Trump. But that didn’t stop him from giving the Trump seal of approval to the franchise in general. “Great stuff,” he told Jimmy Kimmel on Wednesday. “George Lucas, what he’s done is terrific.”
