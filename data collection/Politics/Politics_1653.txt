 Nominating someone to lead the Office of Personnel Management — the federal government’s version of the human resources department — does not typically result in a high-profile showdown. But it might be a different matter with the White House’s announcement on Tuesday that President Obama wants Beth Cobert, currently the acting director, to officially assume the top job. Senate Republicans immediately showed that they intended to make her nomination as much about a serious cybersecurity breach at the agency as about her qualifications. They hope to refocus attention on what they believe is the administration’s inadequate response to cybersecurity threats. The agency disclosed this summer that a major cyberattack against the Office of Personnel Management had exposed the personal information, including fingerprints, of as many as 20 million federal workers, contractors and their families.  Senator Mitch McConnell, the Kentucky Republican and majority leader, said he hoped Mr. Obama and his team would use the confirmation process as “an opportunity to more thoroughly address the legitimate concerns of the American people regarding the cyberattack at O.P.M., particularly the millions who have been harmed by the lack of competence in confronting the attack.”  “The president and his team need to give the American people renewed confidence, and that means pledging to work with policy makers to enact real reforms rather than accepting failure,” he said. Ms. Cobert, a former director and partner at McKinsey &amp; Company, has a solid reputation in the administration and on Capitol Hill. But if she hopes to make it through the Senate, she is going to need to explain what the administration is doing to protect the workers and others whose information was stolen, and what she is doing to prevent a recurrence.
