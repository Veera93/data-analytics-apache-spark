 NASHUA, N.H. — Gov. John R. Kasich of Ohio offered welcoming words to Michael R. Bloomberg on Saturday, suggesting that an independent run by the former New York City mayor could have a positive effect on the presidential race. Mr. Kasich, who has been appealing to centrist voters in New Hampshire, called Mr. Bloomberg a “good mayor” and said, “If he wants to run, he probably will stimulate the debate.” “I’m all in favor of that,” Mr. Kasich told reporters. “Maybe we could have  more serious debate instead of, you know, some of the things we see.” The New York Times reported on Saturday that Mr. Bloomberg was weighing a third-party bid for the presidency. Mr. Kasich spoke to reporters after appearing at a town hall-style event hosted by the New Hampshire Republican Party, which also attracted several other Republican candidates. “I like Michael,” Mr. Kasich said. “I mean, I’m not endorsing him, but I like him.”
