 Ben Carson collected roughly $23 million in the final fund-raising quarter of the year, a large haul at a moment when the candidate is trying to bolster his sagging poll numbers.  Mr. Carson’s campaign spokesman, Doug Watts, confirmed the figure, which was reported first by Politico.  The sum is higher than the nearly $20 million that Senator Ted Cruz, who leads in Iowa polls, raised in the same period. Mr. Carson had been battling with fellow Republican Donald J. Trump for the lead slot in Iowa polls. But after questions about the veracity of some of his claims about his inspirational biographical story and after stumbles over foreign policy, his poll numbers fell, with Mr. Cruz’s rising.
