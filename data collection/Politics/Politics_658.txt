 The White House is looking to Stephanie Cutter, an Obama administration and Senate veteran, to help coordinate the emerging strategy of activist groups in the fight over the Supreme Court vacancy. Ms. Cutter, who met with Senate Democrats at a private lunch on Thursday, led the effort to confirm Justice Sonia Sotomayor from within the White House. A former senior adviser to President Obama and deputy campaign manager in 2012, she played a role on a host of major administration issues, including health care. There are Obama administration alumni and party strategists being recruited for the push against Senate Republicans as well, including Katie Beirne Fallon, who was until recently the White House director of legislative affairs; Anita Dunn, a former White House communications director; Paul Tewes, the former 2008 Iowa state director of Mr. Obama’s campaign; and Julianna Smoot, a top fund-raiser and another veteran of the 2012 presidential campaign. They will be working with a host of activist groups with experience in past Supreme Court fights. Ms. Cutter also worked on Capitol Hill for the Senator Edward M. Kennedy of Massachusetts as well as Senator Harry Reid, the Nevada Democrat and majority leader. She was communications director for John Kerry’s 2004 presidential campaign.
