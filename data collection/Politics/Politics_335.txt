 President Obama will return to his old professorial stamping grounds on Thursday to press his argument for the confirmation of Merrick B. Garland to the Supreme Court. The president is to travel to Chicago to appear at the University of Chicago Law School, where he once taught constitutional law. He will no doubt use this particular presidential lecture before faculty members and students to point out that both he and the Senate have defined constitutional roles to play when it comes to the court. “This is an important constitutional responsibility that the president has fulfilled in terms of nominating somebody with impeccable legal credentials to fill the vacancy on the Supreme Court,” Josh Earnest, the White House press secretary, said on Wednesday. “We are going to continue to make the case to Republicans in the United States Senate that they should fulfill their constitutional responsibility, too, to give him a fair hearing and a timely up-or-down vote. Simple as that.” Republicans say they have fulfilled their constitutional duty of providing advice and consent by refusing to take up the nomination, making it a nonstarter thus far. From Chicago, the president will travel to California for a series of fund-raisers in Los Angeles and San Francisco. It is an election year, after all.
