 SUMTER, S.C. — Donald J. Trump, who had kind words for Gov. Nikki Haley of South Carolina early in the week, ripped into her as weak on immigration on Wednesday after she endorsed Senator Marco Rubio, and the crowd of Trump supporters booed the mention of her name. “She’s very, very weak on illegal immigration,’’ Mr. Trump said, echoing earlier charges that were a departure from his gentler remarks about South Carolina’s governor in speeches this week. “Very weak,’’ he continued. “She’s very, very weak on illegal immigration.

So had his audience’s mood. “You know, Nikki Haley gave a speech a couple of weeks ago and she said that we——’’ Mr. Trump began, waving an arm to include the crowd.   There was a chorus of boos.   “It’s not good,’’ Mr. Trump said.  Then he flung into his criticism of her.
