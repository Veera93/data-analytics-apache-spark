 Donald J. Trump issued the first apology of his presidential campaign — on behalf of one of his interns. Mr. Trump, who was behind Ben Carson in an Iowa poll released on Thursday, retweeted one of his fans who suggested that Iowans had brain issues because of the corn they eat. The Quinnipiac poll is the first time in weeks that Mr. Trump has not had the advantage in a state or national survey. — Nicolas R-V (@mygreenhippo) October 22, 2015  Fearful of offending Iowans, Mr. Trump blamed a “young intern” on his staff for accidentally retweeting the criticism of Iowans to his millions of followers. — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 22, 2015  Mr. Trump has boasted of his affinity for Twitter and social media as a way to hit back at opponents and reach out directly to his supporters. However, he has also gotten himself in trouble by retweeting messages of other people that some considered offensive, and he has rarely apologized.  In this case, even Mr. Trump seems to realize that angering Iowans before the caucuses would not be politically correct.
