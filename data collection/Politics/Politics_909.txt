 Registered lobbyists raised more money for the Democrat Hillary Clinton than for any other presidential candidate of either party during the three months ending in December, according to reports filed with the Federal Election Commission. All told, Mrs. Clinton has taken $2 million so far from donors rounded up by lobbyists, most based in Washington. Lobbyists raised another $236,000 for a joint fund-raising committee Mrs. Clinton set up with the Democratic National Committee, according to the filings. Senator Marco Rubio of Florida was second over all and the leading Republican recipient of lobbyist-raised money during the fourth quarter of 2015, with $676,000 coming in from bundlers who are registered lobbyists. They have raised more than a million dollars for his campaign, the most of any Republican candidate.  Jeb Bush, the former Florida governor, came in third, with less than $200,000 for the quarter and $409,000 for the election cycle. The disclosures are required only for registered lobbyists, not for fund-raisers who happen to work at lobbying firms but are not themselves registered. No other candidate reported any money raised by lobbyists.
