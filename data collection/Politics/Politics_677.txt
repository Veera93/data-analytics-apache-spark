 Melania Trump defended her husband’s policies on deporting undocumented immigrants and temporarily barring foreign Muslims from entering the country on Wednesday in some of her most wide-ranging remarks on policy since Donald J. Trump embarked on his presidential bid. The former model, who was born in Slovenia, has maintained a low profile during Mr. Trump’s run for the Republican nomination. But in a rare interview she made clear that she agrees with some of his most contentious proposals.  “I don’t feel he insulted the Mexicans,” Ms. Trump said on MSNBC’s “Morning Joe” program. “He talked about illegal immigrants.” Ms. Trump said that her own immigration story only solidified her view that a hard line on immigration is necessary. Mr. Trump has called for building a wall along the border with Mexico and deporting any immigrants who are in the United States illegally. “I followed the law,” Ms. Trump said, recalling that she returned to her native country regularly and spent years going through a process to become an American citizen. “I follow the law the way it’s supposed to be. I never thought to stay here without papers.” Ms. Trump is also on the same page as her husband when it comes to his idea of a moratorium on Muslim immigration. Critics compared the idea with the Japanese internment camps that the United States used during World War II, but Ms. Trump said that the temporary plan was necessary for national security reasons.  “We have people coming into the country, we don’t know who they are, we don’t know what they will do,” Ms. Trump said. “He wants to protect the people of America so we have a country and to keep the country safe.”
