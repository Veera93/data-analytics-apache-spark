 Donald J. Trump’s campaign team plans to file a complaint with the Republican National Committee over the way delegates were chosen in Louisiana, where Mr. Trump won the primary but may emerge with fewer delegates than one of his rivals, Senator Ted Cruz of Texas.  According to Barry Bennett, who has been advising the Trump campaign on handling delegates, the primary issue is that Trump representatives were not invited to a closed meeting about how delegates were going to be selected.  “They had this meeting,” Mr. Bennett said, “and they didn’t invite our delegates.” The complaint with the R.N.C. will be filed at its meeting ahead of the national convention in July, Mr. Bennett said.  Mr. Trump had suggested on Twitter over the weekend that he was being cheated out of delegates, adding, “Lawsuit coming.”  Mr. Bennett earlier told MSNBC that he planned to attempt to decertify the delegates at issue, some of whom are uncommitted delegates who had that status right after the primary.  Those bound to Senator Marco Rubio of Florida became uncommitted when he suspended his campaign. That issue is likely to play out over and over again, as those looking to block Mr. Trump from capturing the necessary 1,237 delegates to win the nomination look to peel off the uncommitted.  Mr. Trump’s operation has come under heavy scrutiny as Mr. Cruz and his team have worked within the party’s system of rules to increase his chances if there is a contested convention. Mr. Trump confirmed earlier on Monday that he had hired Paul J. Manafort, a veteran at wrangling delegates over many decades, to lead the effort.
