 As Republican presidential candidates brave the cold in Iowa and New Hampshire, Hillary Clinton heads to San Gabriel, Calif., on Thursday to court an increasingly important, and sometimes overlooked, demographic. Mrs. Clinton will join Representative Judy Chu for the opening of the Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders for Hillary, an outreach group that could help Mrs. Clinton as she looks to broaden the appeal of her campaign. Ms. Chu is chairwoman of the Congressional Asian Pacific American Caucus. Although there has been much discussion about how Mrs. Clinton will need to attract Latino and African-American voters if she reaches the general election, Asian-Americans and Pacific Islanders are a growing constituency that tends to lean Democratic. A study from the University of California, Los Angeles, last summer found that the Asian-American electorate is expected to double to 12.2 million people by 2040, making it increasingly influential. During Mrs. Clintonâ€™s first run for president, she also made a strong push to attract the Asian-American vote. Highlighting her policies on immigration and job training for people with limited English skills, she outperformed Barack Obama, then an Illinois senator, with that group. Mrs. Clinton will also spend time fund-raising on her West Coast swing, attending an event hosted by Lisa Henson and David Pressler at Jim Henson Co. Studios, the original creator of the Muppets. No word on whether Bert or Ernie will be in attendance.
