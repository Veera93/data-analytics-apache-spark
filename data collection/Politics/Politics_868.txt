 Donald J. Trump’s campaign has started emailing supporters asking them to flood New Hampshire as volunteers. The big draw, in addition to “free lodging and meals”? “Potential opportunities to be near Mr. Trump,” said an email to his list of mid-Atlantic supporters.  The email offered people the chance to “phone bank from home or at a group phone bank,” as well as “Visit New Hampshire &amp; Be Boots on the Ground.”  The email included a list of “deployment benefits,” which, in addition to the lodging, meals and proximity to Mr Trump, were: “Travel expenses considered on a case-by-case basis; Bragging Rights. You helped Make America Great Again!”  The effort to recruit volunteers comes after Mr. Trump came in second in the Iowa caucuses, and Mr. Trump himself said his defeat there was because his campaign “didn’t have much of a ground game because I didn’t think I was going to be winning.”
