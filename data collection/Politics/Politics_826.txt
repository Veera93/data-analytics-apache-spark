 The Latino Victory Fund, a Democratic-leaning group looking to elect Hispanics to higher office, made its first Senate endorsement on Thursday in a crucial swing state where the 2016 presidential race is moving toward — Nevada. The group and one of its more famous representatives, the actress Eva Longoria, endorsed Catherine Cortez Masto, the former attorney general in the state. She is the chosen successor of Senator Harry Reid, who is retiring. In a statement, Ms. Longoria said, “It’s time we send the first woman from Nevada – and the very first Latina – to the Senate.” The group has been fighting a parallel battle for political influence against the right-leaning Libre project, which is backed by political groups associated with the industrialists Charles and David Koch.
