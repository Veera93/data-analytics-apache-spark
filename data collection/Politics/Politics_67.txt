 It’s finally here: Election Day. People across the country are turning out to vote on Tuesday morning. We dispatched photographers throughout the country to meet the early birds among us — the first people in line — and asked what brought them to the polls. “I couldn’t sleep because I was so anxious, up at 4 pacing the floor. I am voting for the future of our country and have never felt more fearful about any election in my lifetime.” Serene Jones, New York City “Everyone is the same whether they are black, white, Puerto Rican or Muslim. I want to see young generations come together for equality in this country.” Christina Simmerman, Columbus, Ohio “This is my first time voting. I don’t want to see Trump win.” Ajani Issa, Decatur, Ga. “I want Hillary Clinton to be our next president because Donald Trump is a despicable human being. That’s why I am here at 5:45 a.m. I am voting even before coffee.” Rachel Austin, New York City “I’ve always voted; it’s just what you do. I’m a vet, and things like this are important to me.” Joe Scileppi, Ashland, Va. “I’m here to vote for the next president, either Mr. Donald Trump, or Ms. Hillary Clinton. I still haven’t decided yet; I’ll decide in there.” Abel Morales, Miami “I’m here to make sure Trump doesn’t get elected. To usher in a new era. ... It’s possible for a woman to be elected.” Kai Jackson-Issa, Decatur, Ga. “I start at 7:30, so if I get here at 7, I can vote before I start work and it’s a long day. I have a union meeting tonight and hopefully all my members get out and vote.” Harold Harrington, Flint, Mich. “I want to get off and get my day going. I vote because I have the right and privilege to. It’s a democracy and I want to keep it that way.” Bud Phelan, Canterbury, NH “I was very proud in coming up and voting ... just to have the opportunity to make history once again.” Barbara McLemore, Flint, Mich.
