 The anti-tax group Club for Growth is beginning a $1.5 million advertising buy against Donald J. Trump in South Carolina, with a kitchen-sink-style spot that describes the real estate developer as a fake.  “There’s nothing conservative about proposing the largest tax hike in history,” the narrator says. “There’s nothing conservative about supporting socialized single-payer health care.” The spot, part of the advertising campaign being run by the club’s political arm, Club for Growth Action, then hits Mr. Trump for using the process known as eminent domain “for personal gain.”  “There’s nothing conservative about four bankruptcies,” the narrator says. “There’s nothing conservative about giving money to the Clintons. There’s nothing conservative about Donald Trump.” Mr. Trump is the target of a pile of negative advertising in the South Carolina, with Senator Ted Cruz running two spots against him.  As of two days ago, Mr. Trump’s campaign had decided to only air positive ads. But that will become hard to sustain in the face of a crush of attack spots.
