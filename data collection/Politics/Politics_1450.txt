 Donald J. Trump has widened his lead in New Hampshire, according to a poll released on Tuesday that showed him beating his closest rivals for the Republican presidential nomination by a margin of more than 2-to-1. A CNN/WMUR survey found that 32 percent of likely Republican voters in New Hampshire support Mr. Trump, up from 26 percent in September. In second place was Senator Marco Rubio of Florida, at 14 percent, followed by Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey at 9 percent and Jeb Bush at 8 percent. The poll follows a spate of terrorist attacks around the world and the mass shooting in San Bernardino, Calif., that have made national security a central issue in the 2016 race, but it was taken before Mr. Trump’s provocative proposal to bar Muslims from entering the United States. However, two of Mr. Trump’s campaign chairmen in New Hampshire said they approved of his plan.  While polls show Mr. Trump locked in a tight race in Iowa with Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, Mr. Rubio has become his top challenger in New Hampshire. Mr. Trump has taken a commanding lead there, but Mr. Rubio has the highest-favorability rating of any of the candidates, suggesting that he has the potential to gain ground. Voters see Mr. Trump as the candidate best suited to take on the Islamic State, manage government spending and win in a general election, the poll found. There were also some shifts among the second tier of candidates. Mr. Christie, who has secured several key endorsements in New Hampshire, received a bump in his support from September, while Carly Fiorina, who was surging a few months ago, has seen her support collapse. The poll had a margin of error of five percentage points.
