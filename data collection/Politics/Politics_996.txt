 As word spread that Donald J. Trump had picked up the endorsement of the evangelical leader Jerry Falwell Jr., Mr. Trump took to Twitter to attack a leading Christian conservative supporter of his main rival, Senator Ted Cruz of Texas. Mr. Trump, in a spree of Twitter posts, suggested that Bob Vander Plaats, an influential evangelical figure in Iowa who endorsed Mr. Cruz late last year, tried to use him for personal gain. — Donald J.

Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 26, 2016  In an interview, Mr. Vander Plaats said he thought the tweets showed “who Donald Trump really is.” Mr. Vander Plaats added that Mr. Trump had offered his family a free stay at a hotel in New York City on a rare visit. “The problem is that Donald Trump expects that if he has a friendship with you and he does anything nice for you, he controls you,” he added. Mr. Trump’s Twitter posts reflect his go-for-the-jugular strategy to discredit a rival, which has been a key feature of his campaign over the last seven months. On Monday, Mr. Trump offered a preview of the attacks that former Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg of New York might face if he decided to run for president as an independent. In an interview with CNN, Mr. Trump questioned reports of Mr. Bloomberg’s net worth, which is estimated to be substantially higher than Mr. Trump’s. He also mocked the financial information  terminals named after Mr. Bloomberg that made him his fortune. “I mean if somebody came in,” he told the interviewer, Wolf Blitzer, “and comes up with a better machine than him, people stop using it,” Mr. Trump said. At another point, he added, “It’s so simple.”
