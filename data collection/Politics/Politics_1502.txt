 The reaction of presidential candidates to the shootings in San Bernardino, Calif., underscored the political divide over gun control, with Democrats seizing on the incident to call for laws to stop gun violence, and Republicans skirting that issue and instead expressing support for the victims, law enforcement and first responders. — Hillary Clinton (@HillaryClinton) December 2, 2015  — Donald J.

You don’t do that to people you love.”
