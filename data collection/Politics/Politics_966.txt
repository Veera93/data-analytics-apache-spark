 Fresh off a fund-raiser with Jon Bon Jovi in Philadelphia, Hillary Clinton will return to rural Iowa on Thursday for a whirlwind schedule of events across the state in the final days before Monday’s caucuses.  Caution is the word of the day for Mrs. Clinton. She has organizing events in Newton and Keokuk, and she will meet with Every Child Matters, an education advocacy group in Newton. But don’t expect her to veer off script. (She has not taken questions from the reporters covering her campaign since Dec. 3.) In recent days, Mrs. Clinton has reverted to the stump speech she often delivered in the fall, focusing on the economy and on defeating the Republicans in a general election. As her main opponent, Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, criticizes her ties to Wall Street and her judgment in voting to authorize the Iraq war as a senator, Mrs. Clinton is back to hardly mentioning her “esteemed opponent” by name. As Mrs. Clinton talks about the economic successes of the Bill Clinton years, Mr. Clinton will have a packed schedule across the state with organizing events in Waverly, Mount Vernon, Washington and Ottumwa. Chelsea Clinton will join her parents on the campaign trail on Saturday. “I firmly expect my 16-month-old granddaughter to be the difference in this election,” Mr. Clinton told a crowd on Wednesday. “She can persuade me to do anything.”
