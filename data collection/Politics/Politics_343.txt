 There was no news conference, there were no Twitter posts. There was no steak, no wine, no bottled water.  And then, on what had been perhaps the quietest primary night of Donald J. Trump’s political career, there came an email flash. Just like that, “Lyin’ Ted” and the “Trojan horse” were back.  “Campaign statement,” read the email from Mr. Trump’s spokeswoman, Hope Hicks, delivered first to The Washington Post, then to others upon request.  “Donald J. Trump withstood the onslaught of the establishment yet again,” the statement read.  “Lyin’ Ted Cruz had the Governor of Wisconsin, many conservative talk radio show hosts, and the entire party apparatus behind him,” it continued. “Not only was he propelled by the anti-Trump Super PAC’s spending countless millions of dollars on false advertising against Mr. Trump, but he was coordinating with his own Super PACs (which is illegal) who totally control him.”  And more: “Ted Cruz is worse than a puppet— he is a Trojan horse, being used by the party bosses attempting to steal the nomination from Mr. Trump. We have total confidence that Mr. Trump will go on to win in New York, where he holds a substantial lead in all the polls, and beyond. Mr. Trump is the only candidate who can secure the delegates needed to win the Republican nomination and ultimately defeat Hillary Clinton, or whomever is the Democratic nominee, in order to Make America Great Again.”
