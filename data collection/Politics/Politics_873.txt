 Hillary Clinton’s narrow victory in the Iowa caucuses does not appear to have given her a bounce in the polls in New Hampshire. An NBC/WSJ/Marist survey released Thursday found that 58 percent of likely Democratic voters in the Granite State back Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, while 38 percent support Mrs. Clinton. That result is virtually unchanged from a poll the group released last week before the caucuses. Lee Miringoff, director of the Marist College Institute for Public Opinion, said that Mrs. Clinton continued to face an “uphill fight” in New Hampshire as Mr. Sanders remained popular in his neighboring state.  Mr. Sanders is leading by a large margin with independents, men and younger voters. He is also doing better with women. Mrs. Clinton, meanwhile, has an edge with voters older than 60. There is still hope for Mrs. Clinton heading into the primary on Tuesday, as she overcame a polling deficit in 2008 and defeated Senator Barack Obama in New Hampshire. Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Sanders will also face off for their first one-on-one debate on Thursday night in Durham, N.H., giving voters a last chance to judge them against each other in person.  The poll released Thursday, which was conducted after the Iowa caucuses, had a margin of error of plus or minus four percentage points.
