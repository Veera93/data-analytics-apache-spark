 DES MOINES — Marco Rubio’s musical tastes run toward electronic dance music, Nicki Minaj and rap. But don’t expect to hear them playing over the speakers at his campaign rallies. The Florida senator has a carefully curated playlist — one tailored to the conservative voters he is trying to reach in states like Iowa — that includes some modern Christian rock. One of the more frequently played songs his staff uses to warm up the crowd is a rock ballad called “Greater” by the band MercyMe.  The chorus: “Cause I hear a voice and he calls me redeemed/When others say I’ll never be enough/And greater is the One living inside of me/Than he who is living in the world.” Mr. Rubio, 44, a Roman Catholic whose family converted to Mormonism when he was a boy, but who now also occasionally attends both Southern Baptist-affiliated and Catholic churches, tends not to broadcast his faith the way some other Republican candidates do. And though his initial reticence to discuss it publicly led to a cool embrace from some of Iowa’s evangelical Christians, he is now talking about it more — in ads and on the campaign trail. A recent exchange Mr. Rubio had with an atheist who asked him if he would vow not to be the nation’s “pastor in chief” has made the rounds online and is being heavily promoted by the Rubio campaign.  “You have a right to believe whatever you want, and I congratulate you,” Mr. Rubio told him, adding, “No one is going to force me to stop talking about God.” There is no question the Christian rock is a better bet for his audiences than, say, “Anaconda” by Ms. Minaj.  “Boy toy named Troy used to live in Detroit/Big dope dealer money, he was gettin’ some coins/Was in shootouts with the law/ But he live in a palace.”  And those are just the lyrics suitable to print here.
