 The final scheduled Democratic debate, held in Miami, was raucous, lively and, at times, ugly. Hillary Clinton fought to keep Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont from scoring additional wins next week in Florida and other contests after his surprise victory in Michigan on Tuesday. Mr. Sanders tried to capitalize on his win, dispensing with the pleasantries and the desire he once professed to avoid negative attacks. Mrs. Clinton seemed well prepared to critique Mr. Sanders’s record on immigration-related votes, pressing him as a sympathizer of militiamen who wanted to round up people in the country illegally. Mr. Sanders sounded uncomfortable as he described his opposition to a comprehensive immigration bill in 2007, when he said that it would lead to more depression of wages for American workers, the same position that organized labor held at the time.  Mr. Sanders tried to say he took that position because he found the guest-worker program to be “akin to slavery,” as critics of it have said. But that was a bit of a pretzel twist, and in reality, Mr. Sanders’s 2007 position will not hurt him in the Midwest, particularly in Illinois and Ohio, which also vote on Tuesday. Mrs. Clinton faced some of the toughest questions of the night, in what seemed like a lopsided effort by the moderators as they approached the two candidates. She flashed some annoyance, but held it in check for the most part. And she struck a poignant note when she acknowledged that she was not a gifted politician. Yet she seemed uncertain of exactly how to attack Mr. Sanders, hitting him from the left at times and making an imprecise case against him over his votes related to the government bailout of the automobile industry after the fiscal collapse of 2008. Thursday night, the pendulum swings back to the Republican side, where the four remaining candidates will gather for a debate, also in Miami.
