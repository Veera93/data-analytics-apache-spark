 Marco Rubio’s campaign is hitting the airwaves, releasing its first television ad on Sunday. Mr. Rubio’s first ad focuses exclusively on the Paris attacks and the issue of national security. It will run nationwide on cable networks; the Rubio campaign did not say how much it was spending to air the ad. The ad is simple: Mr. Rubio appears before a black background and speaks directly to the camera, with a slim black shadow creeping into his visage from the side of the camera. “What happened in Paris could happen here,” Mr. Rubio says in the ad. “There is no middle ground.” The context of the ad is a binary choice of “us or them.” Mr. Rubio has tried to portray himself in this election contest as the strongest choice to combat terrorism around the world. The ad closes with a slightly longer riff than the usually rushed approval: “I’m Marco Rubio. I approve this message because there can be no arrangement or negotiation. Either they win or we do.”
