 Donald J. Trump is having trouble keeping some details straight about the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. Three times during the last week Mr. Trump, the leading Republican presidential candidate, has made remarks that do not align with the timeline and details of the hijacking of the planes, two of which crashed into the World Trade Center towers, a third into the Pentagon, and a fourth – after passengers fought back – into a field near Shanksville, Pa. In an interview broadcast Sunday on CBS’s “Face the Nation,” Mr. Trump, a native New Yorker whose primary home is in Manhattan, described how some of the Sept. 11 hijackers sent family members to the Middle East before the attacks. “And those wives went home to watch their husbands knock down the World Trade Center, the Pentagon, and wherever the third plane was going, except we had some very, very brave passengers, wherever that third plane was going.” The plane that dove into the Pennsylvania field – the last of the four to crash – is generally described as the fourth plane. On Tuesday night, speaking at a campaign rally in New Hampshire, Mr. Trump interrupted a young man’s question about the American nuclear bombings of Japan at the end of World War II and shifted the focus to the earlier Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor. Mr. Trump said “the only thing that was worse” than Pearl Harbor was the Sept. 11 attacks, which killed “innocent civilians having dinner.” The plane crashes on Sept. 11 occurred between 8:45 a.m. and 10:05 a.m. And on Monday night, at a rally in Macon, Ga., Mr. Trump decried 9/11 as “an attack on innocent people working in an office and having lunch up on top of the world.” Mr. Trump spoke off the cuff when he made these remarks, as he typically does in his speeches, in which he also usually takes credit for not needing a TelePrompter to express his thoughts.
