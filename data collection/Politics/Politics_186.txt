 For the first time in his campaign, Donald J. Trump is leading the rush to get advertisements on the air.  His campaign recently reserved roughly $200,000 worth of ads statewide in Nebraska and will be the first campaign to go on the air in the state, which votes on May 10, along with West Virginia, and has 36 delegates up for grabs. There have not been many public polls indicating how Nebraska is leaning in the primary.  While the ad buy will not blanket the Nebraska airwaves, it is still a shift in strategy for the Trump campaign. For most of the primary season, Mr. Trump has been reluctant to advertise, not even spending a cent in New York, where he  cruised to victory.  But as his campaign grows and continues to develop a more traditional structure, he has shown more of a willingness to engage in traditional campaign tactics, most notably television advertising.  He spent more than $1 million in the Pennsylvania primary and is nearing $800,000 in Indiana, which votes on Tuesday.
