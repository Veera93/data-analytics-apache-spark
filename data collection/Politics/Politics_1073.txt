 Bill Clinton acknowledged he was in Senator Bernie Sanders’s backyard as he took the stage Wednesday in New Hampshire.  “I know we’re running against one of your neighbors,” Mr. Clinton told the crowd at a campaign rally in Concord. So, as he laid out the differences between Mr. Sanders and Hillary Clinton, he did so with compliments before dwelling on the contrasts. On the water crisis in Flint, Mich., he said that Mr. Sanders “genuinely cared about it,” before adding that Mrs. Clinton looked for a solution while Mr. Sanders called for the governor to resign. (Mr. Sanders did that only after saying he agreed with what Mrs. Clinton had said initially.) On the economy, Mr. Clinton said that both candidates wanted “shared prosperity and less inequality,” but that Mr. Sanders was more about demonizing and breaking up big banks while Mrs. Clinton believed the financial crash was “caused mostly by the failure of government.” But on health care, he took a more direct criticism of Mr. Sanders’s plan: “I don’t want to talk about the merits, I want to talk about the practical reality here.” What followed was the legislative history of the Affordable Care Act in which he listed the difficulty in simply getting it passed – “we had not a vote to spare” – while noting that was with a Democratic supermajority in the Senate and a Democratic-led House. He said that while he thought the Democrats would win back the Senate in November, the House would likely stay Republican, making passing any legislation difficult. That history lesson was part of Mr. Clinton’s argument that Mr. Sanders’s plan for a single-payer health care system was simply not feasible. “It’s a recipe for gridlock,” Mr. Clinton said.
