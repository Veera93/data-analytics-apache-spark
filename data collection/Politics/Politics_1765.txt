 The conservative billionaires Charles and David Koch will sit down for an interview with MSNBC’s Joe Scarborough and Mika Brzezinski to air next week, bringing their campaign to soften their image to a cable news network known for its more liberal-leaning political slant. The taped interview, which will air next Tuesday on “Morning Joe” (6-9 a.m.), will take place at the brothers’ childhood home in Wichita, Kan. The conversation will focus on the role of money in politics, the network said in a news release.  The appearance continues an effort by the Koch brothers to alter the public perception of them, advanced by many Democrats, as a secretive force behind many of the Republican Party’s most conservative positions.
