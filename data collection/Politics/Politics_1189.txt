 Ted Cruz is on a six-day, 28-town swing through Iowa. These are the places, faces and culinary selections of 2016’s first proper bus tour. EVENT 21 Time: 3:55 p.m., Jan. 8 Place: Charles City, Iowa (population: 7,652) Site: Aromas Coffee, packed so tight that sweat-soaked patrons shed several layers Mood: highly caffeinated, boiling hot Stage: Mr. Cruz delivered his speech standing on a chair. Drink order: “If you guys could maybe make espressos all around,” Mr. Cruz began. “Someone said a politician who’s known for being long-winded is going to be talking, so I think caffeine will be helpful.” Reporters’ typical questions, according to Cruz: “Please insult Donald Trump. Please say something nasty about Donald Trump. Can you do a Donald Trump impression?” Highlight: Mr. Cruz, asked about the Benghazi attacks of 2012, deployed an analogy from his home while suggesting that Hillary Clinton had engaged in a cover-up. “In my house, if my daughter Catherine, the 5-year-old, says something that she knows to be false, she gets a spanking,” Mr. Cruz said. “Well, in America, the voters have a way of administering a spanking.”
