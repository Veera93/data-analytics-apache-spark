 Hillary Clinton’s campaign has begun airing a new ad in Iowa and in New Hampshire that was not announced publicly, a spot that focuses on ending “the wage gap” and criticizes Republicans who will let “corporations write their own rules.” The spot, airing in Des Moines and in Iowa City, focuses on a message of economic fairness that Mrs. Clinton has invoked since a campaign kickoff in July. But portions of the message are similar to the one espoused by her closest rival, Senator Bernie Sanders, whose populist appeal has been credited with pushing Mrs. Clinton to the left on key economic issues. “On average, it takes three hundred Americans working for a solid year to make as much money as one top CEO,” the narrator says. “It’s called the wage gap,” the narrator adds, as the words appear in block type on the screen. “And the Republicans will make it worse by lowering taxes for those at the top and letting corporations write their own rules.” Mrs. Clinton will “work to close the wage gap,” the narrator says, adding that she will also focus on equal pay for women, a higher minimum wage and “lower taxes for the middle class. She’ll get the job done. For us.” A Clinton aide declined to say why the spot wasn’t unveiled publicly, or how many ads have been aired that haven’t been released publicly.
