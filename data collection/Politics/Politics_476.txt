 A swooning Chinese economy. The rising specter of global jihad. Russia lurching toward a new Cold War with the West. These are among the top threats facing the global economy, and now a leading risk analysis firm has added another wild card to its list: Donald J. Trump. The Economist Intelligence Unit, based in London, has been carefully monitoring Mr. Trump’s march toward the Republican presidential nomination, and on Wednesday it warned in a report that a President Trump could be a drag on global growth. “In the event of a Trump victory, his hostile attitude to free trade, and alienation of Mexico and China in particular, could escalate rapidly into a trade war,” according to the report. “His militaristic tendencies towards the Middle East (and ban on all Muslim travel to the US) would be a potent recruitment tool for jihadi groups, increasing their threat both within the region and beyond.” The group continues to view the probability of Mr. Trump winning the White House as “moderate,” but says the risks if he does are quite high. The firm’s scale equates the danger of a Trump presidency to the threat of Islamic terrorism, potentially reducing global economic growth by as much as 1.5 percent. Robert Powell, an analyst with the unit who worked on the study, said he could not recall another example of an American presidential candidate reaching its list of the world’s top 10 risks. He said that Mr. Trump’s polarizing nature would most likely bring more government gridlock and his unpredictability would create great uncertainty. “The impact for the world would be bad,” Mr. Powell said. “The impact for the U.S. would be even worse.”
