 Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont was asked on “Meet the Press” on Sunday whether his health care plan, which would raise taxes to pay for more government benefits, would create a problem for House Democrats running for re-election in 2016. “I think in fact Hillary Clinton will be the problem,” Mr. Sanders said, arguing that only a candidate that has inspired a wave of enthusiasm among voters, as he believes he has, would draw the high turnout necessary to beat Republicans in November. Mr. Sanders also was pressed on whether he thought he needed to win in Iowa to have a path to the nomination. After some familiar avoidance on the question, Mr. Sanders offered an answer that did not exactly project confidence. Because of the delegate allocation process in Iowa, Mr. Sanders said, “whether you win by two points or lose by two points, it’s not going to matter a whole lot.”
