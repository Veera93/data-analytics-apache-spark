 Donald J. Trump and Hillary Clinton have struggled during a recent stretch of primary contests, but big wins could be in store for both candidates in New York and Pennsylvania, according to two surveys released on Sunday that show them holding wide leads. According to a Fox News survey, Mr. Trump has a commanding lead atop the Republican field in New York, with 54 percent of likely voters backing him. Gov. John Kasich of Ohio is second with 22 percent, and Senator Ted Cruz of Texas trails with just 15 percent. New York will hold its primary on April 19, and Mr. Trump, a New Yorker, is hoping to hoard as many of the stateâ€™s 95 delegates as possible. On the Democratic side, Mrs. Clinton is maintaining a strong advantage over Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont in the state where she was once a senator, leading him by a margin of 53 percent to 37 percent. Mr. Sanders, who was born in Brooklyn, has been campaigning aggressively in New York in hopes of extending his recent run of primary election victories. There are 291 delegates at stake for the Democrats. Pennsylvania will hold its primary contest a week later, and it also appears to be friendly terrain for Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton, according to a Fox News survey. Of Republican voters, 48 percent back Mr. Trump, with 22 percent for Mr. Kasich and 20 percent for Mr. Cruz. Mrs. Clinton leads Mr. Sanders by 11 percentage points in Pennsylvania, 49 percent to 38 percent. There are 71 delegates at stake for Republicans and 210 for Democrats in Pennsylvania, which will hold its election April 26, along with four other states.
