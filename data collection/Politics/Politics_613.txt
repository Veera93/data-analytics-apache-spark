 Three things were true as “Super Tuesday” ended: Donald J. Trump had a dominant evening, the Republican race will still drag on for a stretch, and Hillary Clinton is edging toward closing the door on the Democratic contest. Mr. Trump, once derided as the “New York values” candidate by Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, handily won seven states, from the liberal Northeast to the Deep South, a show of force that would have been unimaginable just a few weeks ago. However, all was not rosy for Mr. Trump: He won some states by a plurality of less than 35 percent of the vote, suggesting that there was still room for someone to try to stop him. So the race will carry on, even as that window is dwindling. Mr. Cruz, who won in Oklahoma and his home state of Texas, emerged as the candidate in the best position to slow Mr. Trump. Senator Marco Rubio of Florida won Minnesota but came up empty everywhere else, and he failed to clear the threshold in some states for the allocation of delegates. It will now be harder for him to make the case that he is the person to support: So far, he has been graded on something of a curve by donors and pundits. In public polls, he is behind Mr. Trump by double digits. For his part, Mr. Trump seemed mindful that the last several days of news cycles, which were dominated by his declining to disavow the former Ku Klux Klan leader David Duke, were less than ideal. In a subdued election night news conference, Mr. Trump tried to focus on a general election, calling himself a “unifier” as his new sidekick, Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey, stood behind him, seeming somewhat uncomfortable at times. As for the Democrats, Mrs. Clinton also won more than a half-dozen states over Senator Bernie Sanders, including in Massachusetts, which had been expected to favor him. Mr. Sanders won four contests, but he still has to prove he can win in a primary featuring large numbers of African-American voters, who make up the party’s base.
