 Hillary Clinton has brought on one of her closest advisers, Minyon Moore, for a top role in her campaign as the 2016 race moves closer to the general election, an aide confirmed.  Ms. Moore will become a senior adviser, focusing on political outreach and strategy, according to the aide. Ms. Moore will have an office on the campaign’s new 10th floor space at its headquarters in Brooklyn, along a wall featuring other top aides such as the chairman, John D. Podesta; the campaign manager, Robby Mook; the communications director, Jennifer Palmieri; and the policy adviser, Jake Sullivan. Ms. Moore, who worked on Mrs. Clinton’s 2008 campaign as well, is a rarity in the Clinton orbit, in that she bridges the divide between the staffs of Bill Clinton and Mrs. Clinton. She is close with both the former president and the former secretary of state, adding heft to her counsel.  She worked in the White House when Mr. Clinton was president, but she has long been part of a core group of women advising Mrs. Clinton.  Ms. Moore has in recent years been a top official with the Clinton-aligned Dewey Square Group, a consulting firm. Along with her colleagues at the firm, she helped present Mrs. Clinton early on with details about what a second presidential run would entail in 2013.
