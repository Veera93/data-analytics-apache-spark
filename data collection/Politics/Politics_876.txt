 Supporters of Marco Rubio are inviting hundreds of current and potential Rubio donors to a strategy meeting in New York in
mid-February, hoping to capitalize on a potential strong finish in the New Hampshire primary to poach donors. The invitations are one prong in a broader push by Mr. Rubio, who finished third in the Iowa caucuses, to consolidate the party’s major donors in a challenge to Senator Ted Cruz of Texas and the businessman Donald J. Trump. The meeting in New York, which will be headlined by Mr. Rubio’s campaign manager, Terry Sullivan, will likely be dominated by financial-industry contributors, many of whom have the already placed bets on Mr. Rubio. Among those invited to the meeting are donors and bundlers — volunteer fund-raisers — now supporting Jeb Bush and Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey, many of whom are watching to see how well the two men do in New Hampshire on Tuesday.  Some Republicans expect one or both of them to drop out of the Republican race if they finish badly. Even if they do not drop out, Mr. Rubio’s supporters believe, many of their donors may be looking for a new home. Even if donors have given the legal maximum to a candidate, $2,700 per person, they are allowed to give to any other candidate up to that limit.
