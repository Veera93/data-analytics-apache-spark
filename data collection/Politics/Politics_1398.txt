 Donald J. Trump appears to have hired the Donald J. Trump of doctors. A master of the art of exaggeration, Mr. Trump released a health report from his doctor on Monday that oozed the kind of hyperbole the developer tends to exude on the campaign trail. Calling Mr. Trump’s stamina “extraordinary” and predicting that he would be the “healthiest individual ever elected to the presidency,” Dr. Harold Bornstein offered the Republican presidential candidate an immaculate bill of health. Such glowing reviews of Mr. Trump’s vigor raised a natural question: Who is Harold Bornstein? Dr. Bornstein, 68, who declined to be interviewed, comes with extensive credentials. Educated at Tufts University for college and medical school, he did his fellowship in gastroenterology at Yale and entered his father’s medical practice on the Upper East Side of New York.  Mr. Trump was initially a patient of the father, Dr. Jacob Bornstein, before coming under the care of the younger Bornstein in 1980. Records show that Dr. Bornstein, like Mr. Trump, has been married at least three times. He is a father of five, according to the obituaries of his parents. Dr. Bornstein’s social media profiles indicate that he likes pinstripe suits, has long blond hair and enjoys sun-soaked resorts. He is also active on eBay, the online auction website, where he sells a mix of colonoscopy equipment and alligator cowboy boots. Some questioned Dr. Bornstein’s integrity on Monday, calling it a stretch to suppose that Mr. Trump would be more fit than any president in American history.  However, Josh Earnest, the White House press secretary, on Monday gave the doctor points for not being squeamish. “From here, I would not call into question the medical credentials of somebody who decides they are ready to conduct a medical examination of Mr. Trump,” he said. “That must have been a pretty interesting appointment.” Kitty Bennett contributed reporting.
