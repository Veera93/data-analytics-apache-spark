 As vice president as well as president of the Senate, Dick Cheney once asserted that he was essentially his own branch of government. Nevertheless, he will be immortalized in the Senate beginning on Thursday with a traditional marble bust in recognition of his service there. Mr. Cheney is to attend the ceremony along with the man who made him vice president, George W. Bush, after Mr. Cheney conducted a search for the best candidate to join Mr. Bush’s ticket. Though most Americans forget the fact after high school civics class, the chief constitutional duty of the vice president is to preside over the Senate as the institution’s chief officer. In modern times, busy vice presidents do the job rarely, mainly to break ties or to swear in newcomers. But they still maintain an office there. Mr. Cheney’s chiseled likeness will join those of more than 40 other vice presidents, many of them quite obscure, scattered inside and outside the Senate chamber. The bust was sculpted by William Behrends of North Carolina, and the Capitol Hill publication Roll Call recently put its cost at about $50,000.  Mr. Behrends also sculpted the likeness of Vice President Spiro T. Agnew, who served with Richard M. Nixon before resigning under a legal cloud. At the ceremony unveiling his bust in 1995, Mr. Agnew noted that the moment would no doubt renew some criticism of him. Mr. Cheney should probably expect the same along with plaudits from congressional leaders.
