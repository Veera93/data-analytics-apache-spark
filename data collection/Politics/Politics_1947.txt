 BETTENDORF, Iowa — Jeb Bush had been working the room for several minutes, doling out firm handshakes and abbreviated small talk among the mostly middle-age and older voters who came here to hear him speak.

She said she did. “Want to do it with the sticker?”  Yes. “Oh,” Mr. Bush said flatly. “That’s great.” He smiled dutifully and swung his arm around her. Click.
