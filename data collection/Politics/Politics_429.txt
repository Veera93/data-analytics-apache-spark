 Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, who is running for the Democratic presidential nomination, condemned the “cowardly” terrorist attacks in Brussels on Tuesday, saying in a statement: “We offer our deepest condolences to the families who lost loved ones in this barbaric attack and to the people of Brussels who were the target of another cowardly attempt to terrorize innocent civilians. We stand with our European allies to offer any necessary assistance in these difficult times. “Today’s attack is a brutal reminder that the international community must come together to destroy ISIS. This type of barbarism cannot be allowed to continue.”
