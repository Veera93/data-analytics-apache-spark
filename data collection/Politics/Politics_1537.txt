 For residents of the four early voting states seeking respite this holiday weekend from the political rantings of a charged relative, the traditional comfort of television might not provide much of an escape. Presidential campaigns and the groups supporting them have booked almost $5 million in advertising time during Thanksgiving week in Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada and South Carolina, according to an analysis by Kantar Media’s CMAG, which tracks political advertising. Some viewers will, for example, learn about Hillary Rodham Clinton’s record on health care, Senator Bernie Sanders’s plan to fix what he calls a “rigged economy” — two ads that were booked last week and extend through football games and food comas and into the long weekend. Others will hear the story about Marco Rubio’s father, a bartender who emigrated from Cuba, in the Rubio campaign’s first early state advertising, which is running in Iowa starting on Thanksgiving Day. Senator Ted Cruz of Texas and Ben Carson will also be running ads in early states, as will “super PACs,” including Right to Rise, the group supporting Jeb Bush, which is spending $1.9 million over the course of the week in the four states, part of a larger ad blitz. Further cluttering the political airwaves in the early states are the equal amounts of time given to Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, Gov. John R. Kasich of Ohio, James Gilmore and Mike Huckabee, after their campaigns reached an agreement with NBC affiliates in Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina to show commercials equal to the 12 minutes 5 seconds of screen time Donald J. Trump received as host of “Saturday Night Live.” For those early state residents seeking an escape from the campaign season this weekend, it appears that the safest bet is an extra heavy dose of tryptophan.
