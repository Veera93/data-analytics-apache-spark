 For Senator Chris Murphy, Democrat of Connecticut, gun violence was not an issue he ran on: It chose him. The massacre at Newtown Elementary School in Sandy Hook happened a month after he won his seat. His first floor speech was on the issue. After a stinging defeat of a gun control bill on the Senate floor in 2013, most congressional lawmakers abandoned the issue, but Mr. Murphy slogged on. He has given many floor speeches, has sponsored legislation, and on Thursday, he posted a list on Twitter of every mass shooting in 2015. So it was that he found himself with mixed emotions on Tuesday as he watched a tearful President Obama announce a modest package of executive actions on guns, something he has been urging.  “I watched a crowd full of activists enthusiastically cheering a relatively mild step forward on gun laws and thought about how much the debate has changed,” he said. “It would have been inconceivable four years ago to have a room full of cheering advocates at the White House celebrating moving a few inches forward. It was bittersweet. I am thrilled that the president took the action. It’s necessary but totally insufficient.” Mr. Murphy says he still believes that Congress and state governments need to do more to promote gun safety. He knows the obstacles. He has felt defeat, depression, anger, and on Tuesday, a little bit of pride not so much in victory, but its possible specter. “There have been so many reasons for advocates to pack up and go home,” he said. “I think today is proof that didn’t happen and it’s not going to happen. I have a sense of optimism today that the anti-gun-violence moment is here to stay.”
