 Representative Jim McDermott, Democrat of Washington and one of the most liberal members of the House, announced Monday that he would retire at the end of the year, ending a tumultuous 14-term congressional career.  “I love representing the people of the Seventh District because they inspire me to pursue and achieve public policy goals that improve the lives of all Americans,” he said in Seattle.  “I am proud of what we have been able to do together for Seattle and the State of Washington,” said Mr. McDermott, who serves on the powerful Ways and Means Committee, where the Affordable Care Act, which the House is set again to vote to repeal this week, was partially conceived.  “Not surprisingly, not everything has worked out as I had hoped, but, on balance, I will leave the Congress with few regrets,” he said. Mr. McDermott, 79, is a psychiatrist who served in the Navy treating soldiers and sailors returning from the Vietnam War and later as a Foreign Service medical officer stationed in Zaire.  He has represented Seattle and the surrounding communities in the House since being elected in 1988.  While Mr. McDermott has long been known for his work on issues affecting the poor and for his aggressive criticism of the Iraq war, his career was perhaps most noted for being successfully sued by Representative John A. Boehner, Republican of Ohio, over an illegally recorded phone call in 1996 that Mr. McDermott leaked to the news media. The call concerned Newt Gingrich when Mr. Gingrich was speaker of the House.
